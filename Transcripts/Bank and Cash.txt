In the last session we covered intangible non-current assets, the audit of intangible non-current assets and in this session we are going to be covering substantive procedures related to bank and cash. This is the last asset side audit that we are going to be covering. The next sessions are all going to be based on liability side of the balance sheet. Now for bank and cash this is very simple and a straightforward audit. How? Cash in hand is likely to be an immaterial amount because most companies prefer to only hold petty cash in hand at year end. And for cash in hand the audit procedure that the auditor applies is a cash count. It is also physical verification of cash. Since cash count is conducted by the auditor themselves, it is the most reliable form of audit evidence. Therefore not a lot of substantive procedures are required on this area. The next area that we are going to be covering is the bank balance verification and that is done through two processes. The first is sending out a bank confirmation letter. So bank confirmation. And the second is the audit of bank reconciliation statements. We are going to first begin with the bank confirmation letter. Remember from the audit of receivables, we remember that confirmation letters can be in two forms, positive or negative confirmation letters. Banks are sent positive confirmation letters since there are a lot of details that the auditors need to verify from the bank. So one bank confirmation letter will have several areas that the auditors will need confirmation from. Let's first look at an example, an easy example. So we are auditing XYZ company on 31st December 2019, their bank balance was $20,000. We obtain a breakup schedule. And the breakup schedule is several banks. So ABL, UBL and Standard Chartered Bank. All right. So ABL has $5,000. UBL has $10,000. And Standard Chartered Bank has $5,000. So just names of banks. This is just an example, names of banks, hypothetically. The first thing to do, by now you should remember this, we are going to cast the breakup schedule and ensure that the addition total is correct. So we are going to cast it. And the second thing that we are going to do is send confirmation letters out to all of these three banks. So confirmation letters to all three banks. Remember, the business is very likely to have taken out a loan from these banks as well. Therefore, confirmation letters will be sent out to the bank. One confirmation letter will be sent out to one bank. Within these confirmation letters, there will be several contents. Let's talk about the contents and let's talk about the purpose of each content as well. For example, the first content of a bank confirmation letter will be that the auditor will want to confirm the number of accounts that are held in the company's name by the bank. This is for completeness. Why? Because the auditor wants to ensure that if a company holds five accounts in one bank, then the company is also reporting on all five in its balance sheet. So this is to ensure completeness. The second thing that the auditor needs to confirm on a bank confirmation letter is the title of accounts. So in whose name are the bank accounts?
This is to ensure Rights and Obligations because a company's account needs to be in the company's name for it to be recorded in the Statement of Financial Position. The third content of a bank confirmation letter would be the year-end balance. So the auditor would want to confirm the year-end balance in all accounts. This is to confirm accuracy, valuation, and allocation. So AVA allocation of the bank balance. The fourth content of a bank confirmation letter would be the nature of accounts. Normally companies have different accounts, one deposit account or a current account, another a savings account or a term deposit account. Remember, the classification is going to be different in statement of financial position. For example, if it's a term deposit account, then it will be classified as a non-current asset. Right? If it's a loan account or if it's an overdraft account, then it will be classified as a current liability. So nature of accounts is confirmed from the bank to ensure that bank balances are correctly classified in financial statements. The fifth content of a bank confirmation letter would be accounts opened and closed during the year. So several times the company would have opened a bank account and closed it during the year as well. The auditor needs confirmation of those two to ensure completeness and to ensure that all accounts are completely recorded in financial statements. The auditor will also need confirmation of any loans taken out from the bank. This will ensure the existence and completeness of loans. Of loans that the company XYZ company in this example has taken from ABL, UBL or SCB. The nature of loans will also be confirmed. The nature of loans will also be confirmed. Some loans will be current liabilities while other loans will be overdraft, therefore short-term liabilities. Other loans will be based on 10 years, therefore long-term liabilities. So nature of loans for correct classification within financial statements will be confirmed. The outstanding balance of loan will also be confirmed on the same bank confirmation letter in order to ensure accuracy, valuation and allocation of non-current or current liabilities. Assets held as security will also be confirmed in order to ensure correct presentation of assets held as security within financial statements. So presentation and disclosure of assets held as security, so on and so forth. So there are several contents of a bank confirmation letter. Each content has a separate or a different purpose for the auditor. The auditor has to ensure that the bank confirmation letter, one bank confirmation letter fulfills all of these purposes for the auditor. Once a bank confirmation letter has been sent, the next audit process will be the audit of bank reconciliation statement. Remember all of these substantive procedures are given in your notes. You have to memorize them from your notes or you can memorize them from here if this is easier for you to remember. In order to learn the substantive procedures related to bank reconciliation statement. So let's first make a bank reconciliation statement. This would begin with balance as per cash book. Any figure. Then it would be timing differences. The first timing difference would be outstanding lodgements or basically outstanding receipts that will be deducted. Unpresented checks or unpresented payments added. And finally balance as per bank statement. Reconciliation statement. So how do we audit this particular reconciliation statement? The first thing to do is, re-perform the bank reconciliation statement to ensure accuracy or arithmetic accuracy. So the entire statement may be re-performed to ensure its accuracy. Balance as per cash book may be reconciled with the general ledger to ensure that the correct balance has been picked up from the general ledger and mentioned on the bank reconciliation statement. Balance as per bank can be reconciled with the actual bank statement. Balance as per bank can be reconciled with the actual bank statement to ensure that the correct balance has been mentioned on the bank reconciliation statement. And it can also be reconciled with bank confirmation letter. You can reconcile it with any. So this was the second procedure, the third one and the fourth one. So what do we do about outstanding lodgements or unpresented checks? Now remember, these are lodgements or checks that were sent to the bank on the 29th of December or the 30th of December. Since they will be cleared into the bank sometime in January, there are timing differences and these outstanding lodgements and unpresented checks can be traced into post-year end bank statements. Remember, I will give you an example of an outstanding lodgement. Let's suppose a customer has sent money to XYZ company. Now this money was or this check was received by XYZ company on the 29th of December. On this date, this check was sent to the bank and it will be cleared in three working days. Therefore, this check will be cleared on the 3rd or the 4th of January 2020. Therefore, this check will be appearing in the bank statement for January 2020 which is called a post-year-end bank statement since it is received after the year-end. And this is the 5th procedure that you have to remember. And that's about it. That is it for the audit of bank reconciliation statements. It's short, it's simple and very very easy for students to remember. We are now going to progress on to the next session that is going to be based on practice for bank and cash.
