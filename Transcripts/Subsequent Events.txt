 We're now towards the next topic of our syllabus which is review. Bear in mind that this is one of the most important areas from your syllabus perspective and it is very commonly tested in section A and tested in section B as well. For topics that are tested in section A which is the objective test case questions you must know that in-depth knowledge of the concepts is necessary for students to be able to answer questions correctly. Now before we move on into how review sort of gels in with the rest of your syllabus let's look at review as a topic. Review as a topic is broken down into further sub topics. It will include subsequent events. It will include going concern. It will include overall review of financial statements as well as written representations. If you remember from your previous sessions I told you that we are going to be covering written representations in a lot of detail later. For now you just remember that written representations are written statements by the management to the auditor and that's about it and that's all you know. We are going to be covering all of these four topics in a lot of detail. Right now this session will cover the first topic which is subsequent events. Let's now look at how review as a topic gels in with the rest of your syllabus. We started with accepting audit engagements. We then progressed on to planning. We covered tests of controls, substantive procedures and now we're here review. Remember this is one of the last stages before we form an opinion and report on financial statements. Therefore review is one of the most important areas of the practical audit. Let's look at subsequent events. These are events. These are also called events after the reporting date. Subsequent events would also be called events after reporting date. Now this is very very important to remember. We are going to consider for this session that the reporting date is 31st December 2019. So any event that occurs after this date is going to be a subsequent event. Now there are two types of subsequent events adjusting events and non-adjusting events. Now listen to this carefully. Adjusting events normally are those events conditions for which were present before year end. So what does this mean? What kind of events are those for which conditions are present before year end? Let's take an example. An example of events for which conditions are present before year end could be any or could range from defective inventory or default of a receivable. Now this is very very important. Now listen to this carefully. Let's suppose inventory was produced in November 2019. As at 31st December this inventory was unsold and was recorded in inventory as at 31st December 2019. Subsequent to the year end let's suppose this inventory was sold in January 2020 and that's when management finds out that this inventory was defective. Now we know that the defect in inventory was present when it was produced which was in November 2019 therefore this is going to be an adjusting event. This means that in the year-end financial statements management will have to make a provision, will have to write down inventory to its naturalizable value. Similarly default of receivables. Let's suppose the company made a sale to a customer in December 2019. In January 2020 it was found out that the customer filed for bankruptcy and will not be paying the amount back. This is also an example of an adjusting event since the sale was made in 2019 then adjustment would also be passed in 2019 financial statements since conditions for this event were present during the year. Another example of subsequent events are non-adjusting events. These are events that occur after year end and there are no conditions for events were present in prior year. An example of a non-adjusting event would be a natural disaster that occurs or that occurred let's suppose in February 2020 and destroyed all of the inventory that was held as at 31st December 2019. Now since natural disaster occurred after the year and no conditions were present during the year that could have indicated that a natural disaster would occur then this would constitute a non-adjusting event. Similarly another example of non-adjusting event would be dividends declared after year end after December 2019. So any dividends that the company announces and declares on equity after the reporting day is also a non-adjusting event since there was no condition present during the year that indicated that dividends would be declared. However remember a non-adjusting event may impact going concern in which case it should be adjusted in financial statements and if it does not impact going concern then just a disclosure is required in 31st December 2019 financial statements if it is material. So remember now just to summarize this subsequent events may be classified as adjusting events or non-adjusting events. Adjusting events are those that occur after year end however conditions for these events are present in the prior year that's why they are adjusted or recognized in financial statements. Then there are non-adjusting events that occur after year end and no conditions are present in the prior year either. For such events the auditor has to check whether they affect going concern or not. If non-adjusting events impact going concern of an organization then they should be recognized in financial statements. If non-adjusting events do not impact going concern then a disclosure is necessary but only if they are material. Now what is the auditor's responsibility as far as subsequent events are concerned? So we've read what subsequent events are but what we haven't read is how they impact or how it impacts the auditor's responsibilities. So there are three to four dates that are very very important. Let's take an example of a company that has a year end of 31st December 2019 financial statements of this company were approved on the 14th of February The audit report is signed on the 18th of February 2020 and the annual general meeting is on the 5th of March 2020. Again these are all hypothetical dates. I'm just doing this for example. For an auditor the auditor's responsibilities are going to differ between these dates. For example between the date of year end and the audit report is signed. So between these two dates the date the year ends and the date audit report is signed the auditor not only has a duty to identify all subsequent events the auditor would also have to confirm all identified subsequent events with procedures. This is very very important. So remember events that occur after the year end but before the audit report is signed have to be identified and confirmed by the auditor. All events that occur after the audit report is signed till the AGM the auditor does not have to identify these events. Remember I'm using ID for identify. However if the auditor gets knowledge of these events then the auditor would have to confirm them. Knowledge of such events confirmation is necessary. I want you guys to remember this. So which are the two dates that are important? All events that occur after the year end till the audit report is signed have to be identified as well as confirmed by the auditor with procedures. But if an event occurs after the audit report is signed and before the AGM then the auditor does not have to identify these events but the auditor will have to confirm them if they get knowledge. So how does the auditor identify subsequent events? The auditor can identify subsequent events through post-year end minutes of meetings. Remember for example if dividends are declared after year end then evidence of declaration of dividend will be found in post year end minutes of board meetings. The auditor can discuss subsequent events with management and management can tell the auditor if there have been any subsequent events after the year end till the audit report is signed. The auditor can also obtain written representation on the same. Other than this the auditor can obtain confirmation from lawyer if any pending lawsuits have been heard and if decisions have come in so confirmation from lawyer or the auditor can review interim financial statements. That the business may have made for the first quarter or for two months or one month. Confirmation of subsequent events occurs in the exact same manner as substantive procedures of areas. So we've just covered that and confirmation of subsequent events is done through the exact same substantive procedures that we have covered in the past sessions. So remember it is very important for you guys to remember that this may be a direct straightforward question in your exam where you will be asked what the auditors responsibilities are for subsequent events. You're going to tell the examiner that the auditors responsibilities are broken down into two parts. The first part is for all subsequent events that occur after year end and before the audit report is signed and the second part is when the audit report is signed and before the AGM. The auditors responsibilities differ and I would suggest that you learn how the auditors responsibilities are different. For identification of subsequent events these are the procedures that you have to memorize they are given in your notes as well you can go through your notes and memorize them from the study notes too. But let's now look at what happens if there is a subsequent event after the AGM. So what happens after the annual general meeting? Remember in the annual general meeting the annual report carrying the auditors report and financial statements will be issued. So what happens if facts are discovered after financial statements have been issued? Remember they will be issued in the AGM. So what happens if an event that affects 2019 occurs after the AGM? These are very very important from exam perspective. I want you guys to take some moments and learn them all. The first is the auditor would discuss the matter with management and where appropriate those charged with governance. Remember those charged with governance are the board of directors. So first things first the auditor is going to discuss the subsequent event after the AGM with the management and the board of directors. The auditor would also determine whether financial statements need to be amended. So the auditor would determine whether the event is adjusting or not adjusting. If financial statements are in fact adjusted the auditor would have to consider whether procedures need to be applied again. So inquire how management intends to address the matter in financial statements and finally carry out procedures necessary in circumstances on the amendment. If these procedures require a change in opinion then the audit report will have to be reissued. You have to remember that. So if while carrying out procedures the auditor finds out that the opinion has to be changed then the auditor would change the audit report and then reissue it. So what is the technique of answering a subsequent event question? Should this question come in your exam? How will you answer this? So within the technique the first is you will be given so remember you will be given a scenario a small scenario just like you get small scenarios for substantive procedures. So we did small scenarios for all areas of substantive procedures and for subsequent events as well you're going to get the exact same type of scenario. You will be asked to discuss the issue so you will have to discuss the issue in detail and you will be asked to comment on materiality as well as write procedures. What are you first going to do? You're going to first identify whether a procedure is adjusting or not adjusting and then explain why an event is adjusting. Then you have to explain the impact on financial statements. You will discuss the materiality of the issue and then write scenario specific procedures. If you don't understand this technique right now please hold on till the next session which is based on practice of subsequent events. It will then be very very clear for you. So first you have to explain why an event is adjusting or not interesting. You have to discuss the impact on financial statements. You have to discuss materiality and finally write scenario specific procedures.
