 Another topic that we need to cover is laws and regulations. Now, laws and regulations are all of those laws and regulations that are applicable on financial statements and businesses as a whole in whatever country they operate. As such, from laws and regulations perspective, we as auditors are supposed to know, are we responsible for compliance or checking compliance with laws and regulations or not? Now, first things first, what are the management's responsibilities and the auditors' responsibilities? Remember, management's responsibilities are to ensure compliance with all laws that are applicable on financial statements as well as the business. Now remember, there will be certain laws that are directly applicable on financial statements, for example, reporting requirements of stock exchange, for example, international accounting standards or international financial reporting standards. Now, these are laws and regulations that are directly applicable on financial statements. There are other laws and regulations that are applicable on the organization, for example, licenses or environmental laws, so on and so forth. So management is responsible for ensuring that the business is compliant with all laws, whether they are applicable on financial statements or the organization's operations that are applicable on a business. What are the auditors' responsibilities, therefore? The auditors' responsibility is just to check compliance. And remember, the difference between an auditor's responsibility and management's responsibility is just one word. Management ensures compliance while the auditor checks compliance. With these one-word differences, the highest risk is that this may come in your exam and students may miss this small difference in the statements and end up giving the wrong answer. So remember, read each and every word carefully because the difference in management's responsibility as well as the auditor's responsibility is just one word. Management ensures compliance while the auditor checks compliance. So how does the auditor check compliance? There are two kinds of laws that we talked about. Laws and regulations that have a direct impact on financial statements, like I just discussed with you earlier. For example, international accounting standards, international financial reporting standards, reporting requirements of the stock exchange where the company is listed, so on and so forth. For these laws, these laws are called direct laws from exam perspective. So for direct laws, the auditor needs to gather sufficient appropriate audit evidence that the entity has complied with such laws and regulations. So the auditor has to check compliance with all laws, direct laws that are applicable on the form and structure of financial statements. Then there are indirect laws. Indirect laws are those that have an indirect impact on financial statements or very easily those that affect operations of an organization but not the financial statements per se. For such laws, the auditor must maintain professional skepticism and apply specific procedures to identify non-compliance. Now that's the difference, just a small word. For direct laws, the auditor has to check compliance by gathering sufficient appropriate audit evidence. For indirect laws, the auditor has to maintain professional skepticism in order to detect non-compliance. In easier words, this is the difference or this is the same difference that there is between reasonable and limited assurance. One's with higher level of confidence and the other one is with lower level of confidence. While the auditor does apply procedure and checks compliance with all direct laws that affect financial statements, the auditor only maintains professional skepticism and applies specific procedures to detect non-compliance in indirect laws case. Now what are those specific procedures, these three? Reading minutes of board meetings to identify whether the business has breached any indirect law. Inquiring of management or legal advisors concerning litigation or claims brought against the entity to identify any breaches in indirect laws or undertaking substantive tests on classes of transactions or account balances like checking correspondence, check correspondence with regulatory bodies in order to detect non-compliance with laws and regulations. So these are the three specific procedures that the auditor may apply. How will this feature in the exam? The examiner may ask you to differentiate between direct laws and indirect laws. The examiner may ask you to differentiate between the auditor's responsibilities as far as direct or indirect laws go. Or the examiner may simply ask you to write down specific procedures that the auditors may apply to detect non-compliance with indirect laws. I would suggest that all the text that there is on this slide, you learn it. By the way, this is also given in your notes, so just in case you want to go through a slightly detailed version of this, you can go through the notes. This is a summarized version and would just work just as well. So you can learn this or from your notes.
