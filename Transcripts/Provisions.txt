 Now we've already covered substantive procedures related to payables and loans and now we are going to be covering substantive procedures related to provisions and estimates. Now remember there are a lot of provisions and estimates that have been mentioned in your exam and that have previously been examined by the ACCA. However, some of them or an example of them I'm going to be mentioning here in this session. I would suggest that all of you go through the procedures, detailed procedures given in your notes for provisions and estimates in detail before you progress through to the practice session. Now, since we are going to be talking about substantive procedures related to provisions, I'm going to be primarily talking about three major provisions. Provision against lawsuit. Provision against warranty. And provision against restructuring or reorganization. All right. This is all very, very important. Now, let's start with lawsuit and then progress on to the other provisions as well. For lawsuit, number one. We have to. Ensure that a lawsuit existed at year end. How will existence be confirmed? Through confirmation from a lawyer. So confirm from lawyer. So how will this substantive procedure be written in the exam? You would say confirm from lawyer all lawsuits pending against the company at year end. For completeness, the same procedure will be used. And that is the process of. Confirmation from lawyer. The third is. The cost or the economic outflow of benefits against the lawsuit. So the cost associated with the lawsuit will be confirmed from the claim filed against the company. So remember instead of client, you're going to mention the particular company name in your exam. Okay. So, you are going to say, confirm the cost of lawsuit from the claim filed against the company XYZ. So, next is the likelihood of a successful claim. Why is the likelihood or the probability important? Because according to IAS 37, the accounting treatment of any provision depends on whether it is probable, possible or remote. A contingent liability is only disclosed if the chances of an outflow happening are less than 50%. But if the probability of an outflow occurring is more than 50%, then a provision has to be required. So, therefore, likelihood of a successful claim will be confirmed from the lawyer again. This likelihood can also be confirmed from post-year end events. This is very important. You could confirm from post-year end events if the lawsuit has been heard by court and if it has been successful against the company. In that manner, you will know what is the amount of lawsuit that a provision needs to be created for. Other than that, you could review notes to the financial statements to ensure that an adequate disclosure has been given. So, these are the procedures that you can use for any lawsuit filed by customer, a supplier or an employee for unfair dismissal. Right! So, you can use this for any of the lawsuits filed against the client. Let's talk about warranties for a moment. The first procedure for provision for warranties would be Discuss with management the basis or the assumptions used for estimating provision for warranties and check whether these assumptions were reasonable. The second procedure that may be applied would be obtain a written representation from management regarding assumptions underlying a warranty provision. So it's the same. Now this is a technique that you can use in the exam as well. Whatever you are discussing with the management verbally, the auditor can also take a written representation from the management on the same in order to confirm in writing what assumptions have been used in estimating provision for warranty. The third is compare the warranty provision with last year to ensure that it is consistently applied and you can also compare with industry average to ensure that the provision is reasonable. You can also recalculate provision for warranty for accuracy. Other than that, you can also review post-year end events to ensure that the provision is adequate. Now I'll explain this a bit. So let's suppose that the business has created a provision of $1,000 for warranties for the next year 2020 as at 31st December 2019. Now when January starts, warranty claims of let's suppose $600 have already been made. Now this is a post-year end event since it is occurring after the year end of 31st December 2019. Since in only January 2020, $600 worth of warranty claims have been made, this shows that the warranty provision for entire year of $1000 may have been understated. So the business and the auditors will review whether this provision created was adequate or not. So this is what it means by this procedure. Review post-year end events to confirm that the provision for warranty created was adequate. Seventh is reviewing notes to financial statements for adequacy of disclosure. Now the next is restructuring or reorganization. So this is where the business tries to change, drastically change its business processes. Within restructuring, there would be disposals of old assets. There could be additions or new additions in tangible non-current assets. Or there could be redundancies of employees if business processes are being automated. So restructuring or reorganization could be a combination of all three or some of them. The first procedure is checking the approval of restructuring from minutes of board meetings. To ensure that restructuring was approved by the board during the year. The second procedure could be obtaining a breakup schedule and casting it. In order to ensure that the correct figure is mentioned in trial balance and financial statements. Other than this, the cost of expense. Any expense that is associated with restructuring or reorganization can be matched with purchase invoices or bills. Remember these bills and invoices are third party documents. Therefore, they are reliable forms of audit evidence. In case of redundancy, you can ensure that announcement of redundancy was made before year end through minutes of board meetings. You could recalculate redundancy expense. And you could then review notes to financial statements to ensure adequate disclosure has been given for the reorganization or restructuring. You can notice that I have not mentioned any of the expenses or any of the procedures that are associated with disposals or additions of tangible non-current assets. That's because we've already gone through procedures associated with additions and disposals of tangible non-current assets in the asset session. So if you want to brush up on your knowledge or brush up on your procedures associated with tangible non-current assets, you can absolutely go and look for that particular session. And you can brush up on your procedures associated with additions and disposals. In the next session, we are going to be practicing a past exam paper question based on provisions and estimates.
