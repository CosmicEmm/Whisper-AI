In the last session we covered subsequent events and in this session we are going to be covering going concern. Just to recap, review carries 4 major topics. The first one is subsequent events in no particular order. The second is going concern. The third is overall review of financial statements and the fourth is written representations. This is what you need to remember. So we are going to progressively cover one by one all of the topics that are linked with review. Before we begin going concern, I need to recap with you what going concern actually is. Going concern is the assumption that the business will continue for the foreseeable future. So this is the assumption that covers the upcoming 12 months. This is very important and I want you guys to remember this when we are talking about going concern further along the session. Going concern is not concerned with historical information. It is not concerned with the past financial statements. Going concern essentially covers the next 12 months and covers what is going to happen in the upcoming financial year for the company. We say that a business is going concern if management is sure that the business will continue for the next 12 months which is also called the foreseeable future. We say that a business is not a going concern if the management is sure that the business will fight for bankruptcy and will liquidate its assets in the upcoming 12 months. There could also be a material uncertainty about going concern. So management could be unsure whether the business is a going concern or not. I will tell you examples of those situations. The business has applied for a loan as at 31st December 2019. The business is not sure whether the loan will be provided. Management thinks that if the loan is provided then the business will continue for the foreseeable future and will therefore be a going concern. And the management thinks if the loan is not provided then the business will not be able to continue for the upcoming 12 months and therefore will not be a going concern. This is called a material uncertainty about going concern because the management is just not sure. The going concern assumption is based on whether loan will be provided or not. Similarly there could also be another material uncertainty about going concern. Let's suppose a major lawsuit has been filed against the company. The decision for the lawsuit is pending at year end so as at 31st December the decision for lawsuit is pending. However the management is unsure whether the business will be a going concern. If the business wins the lawsuit then the business will be able to continue in the foreseeable future and will therefore be a going concern. If the business loses the lawsuit then the amount that will have to be paid will be paid by liquidating assets. Therefore the business will not be a going concern in that case. So in both these examples there was one commonality. There was a material uncertainty about going concern. When this happens what does the accountant do or how is this recognized in accountancy? So let's look at the impact on financial statements of going concern. If the company is a going concern normal financial statements will be made and a disclosure will be given. Now listen to this carefully. A disclosure will be given based on assumptions that management used to estimate that the business will continue for the foreseeable future. If there is a material uncertainty regarding going concern and we just covered this. If there is a pending loan or a pending lawsuit then normal financial statements will be be made and a disclosure will be given to disclose the nature of uncertainty. So the disclosure will include whether it's a lawsuit or a loan that is pending and casts a doubt over the business's going concern. However, if the company is not a going concern then alternative basis is used which is also called breakup basis of accounting is used and a disclosure will be given that will specify reasons why the business is not a going concern. Now over here a question that should arise in your mind is what exactly is alternative basis of accounting or what exactly is alternative basis for preparing financial statements? Now alternative basis is used only when and now listen to this carefully, only when management is absolutely sure that the business will not survive in the upcoming 12 months and that the business will go bankrupt.

Alternative basis includes the following: No assets or liabilities will be non-current. Why? If the business is not going to survive for the upcoming 12 months then no asset or no liability will provide benefit beyond 12 months because that is the definition of non-current. Any asset that provides benefit after 12 months and any liability that needs to be paid after 12 months but since the business won't survive the next 12 months then all assets and liabilities will be reclassified as current assets and current liabilities. All assets will be held at realizable values so there will be no assets that will be held at network values or market values. All assets will be held at realizable values meaning if the asset is sold today what is the value that the business will realize. So all assets will be held at realizable values. All assets will be written down to their realizable values. There will be additional provisions and write offs in profit or loss. So when you write off value of assets or you write off any allowance for receivables they will be written off through profit or loss therefore profit or loss will carry a higher number of provisions and write offs. So this is the meaning of alternative basis. All assets and liabilities will be classified as current. All assets and liabilities will be held at realizable values and additional provisions and write offs in profit or loss account.

We are now going to see what are the responsibilities of management and auditors as far as going concern is related. So management's responsibilities include assessing the ability of the company to continue in the next 12 months. So it is the management's decision or the management's estimate of whether the business will survive or not. It is the management's responsibility to disclose uncertainties regarding going concern and it is the management's responsibility to adjust financial statements and disclose matters related to going concern. To summarize, management decides whether the business can continue in the foreseeable future or not. Management discloses uncertainties if there are any and management adjusts financial statements and discloses issues related to going concern if there are any.

So what are the auditors' responsibilities? The auditors' responsibility is to check whether management's assumption is realistic. So whatever assumption management is making over here, it is the auditors' responsibility to check it and ensure that it is reasonable. So the auditor will check whether management's decision regarding going concern is correct in simpler words. And the auditor will ensure if financial statements have been prepared using the appropriate going concern assumption. So the auditor will check whether disclosures and basis for accounting is correct. So the management decides and the auditor checks. The management gives a disclosure in financial statements and the auditor checks. So decision is the management's and the checking is by the auditor. So how does the auditor check whether management's assumption is realistic or not? The auditor looks for indicators that suggest that business may not be a going concern. So the auditor is going to check management's decision by looking for indicators that suggest business may not be a going concern. And once the auditor finds those indicators, the auditor confirms the indicators with procedures. So this is how the auditor is going to check. So naturally the next question that you may be thinking about is what are those indicators and what procedures are we talking about?

So let's consider some of the indicators that the auditor could expect to find in a company that might not be a going concern. So these are some indicators that you see on your screen. A company may not be a going concern if it has a net liability position or a net current liability position. What does this mean? This means that a business where liabilities may be more than assets may find it difficult to survive the next 12 months. A net current liability position means that current liabilities are more than current assets. Another indicator that could suggest that a business is not a going concern is that fixed term borrowings approaching maturity without realistic prospects of renewal or repayment. So maybe a long-term loan is maturing, needs to be repaid and it is highly unlikely that the bank will renew it, which means that the company will have to liquidate assets and repay the loan. Excessive reliance on short-term borrowings to finance long-term assets. So this indicates that the business does not have enough cash to sustain its operations or is not generating enough cash from its activities, therefore has to take short-term borrowings in order to finance long-term assets. Adverse key financial ratios means a decreasing trend in operating profit margin, a decreasing current ratio, an increasing inventory turnover period, which means inventory is held in warehouse for a long period of time and it becomes obsolete, increasing debt collection period, which means that receivables are not paying the company on time, therefore leading to cash flow problems. Substantial operating losses and consistent operating losses. Consistent operating losses would mean or would show that the business is not able to turn a profit over a long period of time. Discontinuation of dividends, which shows that the business is not earning enough to pay its shareholders their dividends and inability to pay payables on due dates, which could lead to withdrawal of credit terms by suppliers. All of these indicators, and this is not an exhaustive list, your study notes has a long list of indicators that might suggest that the business may not be a going concern and while you are not expected to learn all of these indicators, you should be familiar with them. So don't try and learn these indicators from the notes, what you need to do is read through them from your study notes to familiarize with them. Why? These indicators will be given in the form of a scenario in your exam. From that scenario you will have to identify the indicators yourself.

The next step is confirming the indicators through procedures. So the procedures are used to confirm the indicators in the previous slide. Once the auditor finds indicators, remember the auditor never ever forms an opinion without confirming anything. So once as an auditor I have found indicators, I am now expected to confirm the indicators from procedures. One procedure could be evaluate the management's assessment and check whether underlying assumptions are reasonable. You could obtain a written representation on the same. You could read minutes of meetings to identify any current or potential cash flow difficulties. You could review post-year-end management accounts to ascertain whether sales are dropping or profit is decreasing. You could review cash flow forecasts to check whether sufficient cash is being generated. You could confirm the existence, terms and adequacy of borrowing facilities to check whether the business has enough borrowing facilities for the upcoming year or confirmation from lawyers in case of pending lawsuits. Just a quick recap, remember lawyers are one of the experts that may be used during the course of the audit. So this was going concern. How going concern impacts financial statements, how the auditor is supposed to look for indicators and how the auditor confirms those indicators through procedures.
