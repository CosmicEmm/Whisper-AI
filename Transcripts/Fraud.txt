 We are now going to cover fraud as a topic and fraud is a very important topic from exam perspective because it normally does form a part of questions in section A and section B as well. Direct straight forward questions are very common from this topic so I would suggest that you go through it in detail from your notes and the session as well. In order to understand fraud, let's first look at the types of fraud. We know that fraud is intentional and therefore concealed. Because it is intentional and concealed, fraud is difficult to detect. Alright, now there are two types of fraud. The first type is fraudulent financial reporting which includes falsification of transactions or recording fake transactions in a revenue ledger or in the receivable ledger or in any asset ledger. It could involve intentional omission of transactions. For example, transactions that lead to liabilities or transactions related to expenses could be omitted. It could be misapplication of accounting policies. So the business could, in years that their profit is lower, stop charging allowance for receivables or could increase or decrease depreciation by changing accounting policy and it could be manipulating records or window dressing records by overestimating or underestimating useful lives or residual values so on and so forth for assets. All of these four if done intentionally are called fraud and fraudulent financial reporting in detail.

Now, misappropriation of assets means theft or stealing of assets. So misappropriation of assets could involve misappropriation of cash or embezzlement of cash. It could involve stolen inventory. It could involve theft of tangible non-current assets or it could involve personal use of business assets. So all of these are types of fraud. Why are they being communicated to you? Because as an ACCA student, as an audit student, you should know what are the types of fraud so that you're able to detect it when you're checking financial statements in detail.

So what are the responsibilities regarding fraud? Remember management is responsible. So it is the management's responsibility for preventing and detecting fraud. So remember it will always be the management's responsibility to prevent and detect fraud. They could do so by making controls and by making controls such that financial statements are less susceptible to fraud. They could do so by increasing supervision on business processes. So preventing and detecting fraud is the management's responsibility.

Then what exactly is the auditor's responsibility with regards to fraud? I would suggest that you have to learn these points. They are very important from exam perspective. So what are the auditor's responsibilities with regards to fraud? The first is when the auditor is planning the audit, the auditor should keep an open mind and should consider which areas have a higher risk of fraud. These could be areas where dealing with third parties is higher. For example, shortlisting suppliers for a purchase or hiring new candidates or it could be obtaining quotations from different vendors. So the auditor during planning has to identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in financial statements due to fraud. 2) The auditor has to obtain audit evidence regarding assessed risks of material misstatement. So wherever the auditor, this point means it is linked with the first point. The first point was to identify which areas in financial statements are more prone to fraud. And then the second point is designing procedures such that if there is fraud, the auditor can detect it. 3) The auditor is responsible for maintaining professional skepticism. Professional skepticism means a questioning mind, looking at everything with the point of view that it could have fraud or it could include fraud. So having a questioning mind, having an open mind towards the possibility of fraud. So looking at everything like it could have fraud. 4) To ensure that the engagement team is aware of the risks and responsibilities for fraud and error. So the fourth point is to make sure that there is open communication between the team so that everybody discusses amongst themselves which are the areas which are more prone to fraud or most vulnerable to fraud. 5) And finally, in situations where external auditor does detect fraud, then the auditor will need to consider the implications for the entire audit. For example, the implications would mean increasing extent of testing or changing the audit opinion, so on and so forth. Reducing materiality levels. So there could be several implications for the audit.

Remember, the auditor's responsibilities are, just to summarize, to assess the risk of fraud in areas within financial statements, to design procedures in order to detect fraud from those areas which are most vulnerable to fraud, to maintain professional skepticism that is keep a questioning mind towards areas within financial statements and to ensure that the whole team is aware of the possibility of fraud within financial statements. So this ends fraud. In the next session, we are going to be covering laws and regulations.
