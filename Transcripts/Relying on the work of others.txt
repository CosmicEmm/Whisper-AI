 We are now towards the end of our substantive procedure topic and towards the end we are going to cover relying on the work of others. Often times during the audit, the auditor would have to rely on the work of experts in fields other than accounting and auditing. Since the auditors are considered experts in fields of accounting and auditing, any other expert that the auditor might need during the course of the audit would be considered an expert. But when we talk about others, what other experts are we talking about? We are talking about lawyers that are needed to confirm provisions, specifically provisions against lawsuits. We can be talking about valuers that are needed to confirm market value of assets. Or we could talk about tax consultants that are needed to confirm the tax liabilities outstanding for a company. So these are the three experts that we could be talking about. Now when the auditor needs an expert during the course of the audit, there are two possibilities. Let's take one example. You're auditing a client that tells you that they have revalued their assets, their land and building during the year. They have a valuers report from whom they got their valuation done. Now the auditor has two choices. The auditor can use the work of the expert that the management hired or the auditor could hire their own expert and get the work done again. So there are two choices. Either get the work done again by their own expert or use the work of the expert that was hired by the management. So which should the auditor choose? Now remember, the auditors don't believe in duplication. They don't want to do something that has already been done. So the auditor will want to use management's expert. However, management's expert will have to meet standards set by the auditor. If management's expert does not meet the standards set by the auditor, then the work would have to be performed again by an expert or the auditor would have to hire their own expert. So how does the auditor evaluate the work of another expert? The first step is evaluating the expert themselves. The expert should have three qualities. The expert should be qualified in the area that they are handling. So the lawyer should have a qualification related to law. The valuer should have a qualification that is related to actuarial valuation. And the tax consultant should have a qualification that is linked with tax accountancy. The second criteria is the expert should be experienced. So the expert should have past experience of performing similar tasks. For example, the lawyer should have been on another company's contract and would have been providing the same kind of services, for example, vetting or confirming provisions for lawsuits. Similarly, a valuer should have experience in valuing land and building for similar companies in the past. And the last criteria is the expert should be independent. The expert should not be influenced by management, shareholders or any other party. For example, management tells you that they checked land and building for revaluation during the year. They also have an expert's report. So happens that the expert that was hired by the management was the chief executive officer's brother or the CEO's brother. In that case, the expert may be qualified, the expert may be experienced, but the expert is not independent. So the expert will have to meet all three criteria in order for the auditor to use the expert's work. Once the expert has been checked for all standards by the auditor, then the expert's work has to be evaluated too. So there are three things that the auditor needs to check in the expert's work. The first is assumptions used by the expert. So assumptions used should be reasonable. The source data used in the expert's report should be reliable. And the conclusions in the expert's report should be consistent with other forms of audit evidence. Now any assumptions that are used by the expert should be reasonable. We've done this before. We've covered assumptions being reasonable in the audit of estimates. Any source data that the expert has used has to be from an reliable source. For example, source data like data related to inflation or interest rates should be sourced from government publications rather than blogs or forums. And the conclusions that the expert has reached should be consistent with other audit evidence that the auditor has. For example, the auditor has prior evidence that says or suggests that land and building may be impaired. If the expert conclusion is that land and building should be revalued upward, then the auditor should hire their own expert and get the work done again. So just to summarize all of this, an auditor can use the work of an expert during the course of the audit. However, when the auditor needs to give an opinion on financial statements, please remember that the auditor cannot say in the audit report that these are the areas that I did not check. So the auditor has to give an opinion on financial statements in totality. It has to be on the entire set of financial statements, even on the work that is not done by the auditor himself. That's why the auditor needs to be very, very particular when they're using the work of someone else in their audit. So the auditor is not going to check the experts themselves. They're going to check the experts' work too. And if all six criteria are met, only then can the experts' work be used in the audit. The experts themselves have to be qualified, experienced and independent. Their work should have assumptions that are reasonable, source data that is reliable and conclusions that are consistent with other audit evidence. Only then can the auditor use the work of an expert. And even then, when the auditor is giving an opinion on financial statements, they have to make sure that they're giving the right opinion and they will give an opinion on the experts' work too. Therefore, the auditor has to be careful. In the next session, we are going to progress on to the next major topic of your syllabus, review.
