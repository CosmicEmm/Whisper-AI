This session is going to be based on the last component of review. We began with subsequent events we then progressed on to going concern and The last session that we did was based on written representations This session is going to be based on overall review of financial statements At this point the auditor is winding up the audit The auditor is trying to look for areas that the auditor may have missed during the course of the audit Because after this session or after this stage the auditor is going to form an opinion and then prepare a report Based on their findings So it is very important and a very crucial stage of audit at this point The auditor has to ensure that they have applied efficient procedures They have gathered appropriate audit evidence They are going to form an opinion and they need to make sure that that opinion is correct Remember overall review is important from a direct straightforward Perspective and may feature in your exam in a direct straightforward manner So I would suggest that you learn the points from your notes. They're given on page number 136 They're given on page number 137 as well So you can remember any of the points given there.

The first step in overall review is to ensure compliance With all applicable laws. So at this point the auditor is going to have an overall look at financial statements and ensure that whatever financial reporting framework is being used or whatever suitable criteria was, do financial statements match with that suitable criteria or not? Applicable laws could be national laws, could be international accounting standards or international financial reporting standards. The auditor also has to check whether adequate disclosures for accounting policies have been given in financial statements. At this point the auditor also has to ensure that sufficient appropriate audit evidence has been gathered because remember if there is an area where audit evidence is deficient, the auditor still has a chance to apply audit procedures and then gather enough audit evidence. So this is the stage where the auditor has to take a complete comprehensive look at the audit and ensure that in all material areas the auditor does have sufficient appropriate audit evidence because if they find audit evidence deficient in some area then they still have the chance to apply further audit procedures. They can at this point apply final analytical review. Now this is very very important. Remember the analytical procedures we've covered over different stages of the audit. Just to recap analytical procedures are those that involve comparisons and we have now applied them at three different stages of audit. First at the planning stage, second at the substantive procedure stage and Third at the review stage. Now listen to this carefully. At planning stage analytical procedures were applied to facilitate risk assessment. At Substantive stage analytical procedures were applied to gather evidence on multiple assertions. At review stage or this stage the analytical procedures are applied to identify and investigate any unusual differences that the auditor missed in the first place. Now remember financial figures in the financial statements would have changed now because the auditors would have suggested some adjusting entries and those might have been passed by the management. So financial figures that were at the beginning of the audit are not going to be the same at the end of the audit as well. So therefore analytical review is applied again to calculate variances and if any variance is unusual and has not been investigated, now is the chance for the auditor to investigate it finally. The fifth reason for applying overall review of financial statements is to ensure that financial statements are consistent With the auditors understanding and that's very very important. So at this stage the auditor is going to ensure that financial statements finally present a picture that the auditor understands in the first place. Once this overall review has ended the next stage is going to be forming an opinion on financial statements and then designing an audit report. So this was your review stage. We covered four components of review in four different sessions beginning with subsequent events, going concern, written representations and the overall review of financial statements. In the next session We progress on to opinion.
