 In the last session we covered audit opinion and in this session we are going to be covering audit report. Remember that audit report and opinion are very likely to be tested together. Therefore we are going to do a practice question, an example question after we are done with the report session. There are two types of audit report just like there were two types of opinion. So there is unmodified audit report or there is a modified audit report. In simpler words unmodified means unchanged and modified means changed. So what does unmodified mean? This means unchanged from the standard format. Now I want you guys to listen in carefully. Just like financial statements have a set format according to international accounting standards, there is a set format for audit report according to international standards on auditing. If the audit report is made according to the set format without any changes, then that report will be called an unmodified report. Within an unmodified report only a clean opinion can be given. So there is only room for a clean opinion or an unqualified opinion in an unmodified report because the standard format carries a clean opinion or an unqualified opinion. Now modified audit report means changed from the format prescribed by ISAs. So what change could be included or how the report could be changed? So the auditors may want to change the wordings of existing paragraphs or put in additional paragraphs. One of the two. Sometimes the auditor wants to change wordings of existing paragraphs. Other times the auditor may want to add an additional paragraph. So let's first look at modifications in an audit report. We've already discussed what an unmodified audit report is. Now an audit report may have an opinion on financial statements and remember every time the opinion is modified, the wordings of existing paragraphs will change. Words in report will change. Therefore, report will be modified. The minute the auditor changes something in the audit report, the audit report automatically becomes a modified audit report. It is as simple as that and I want you guys to remember it as simple as that. Because whenever the auditor changes anything within the audit report, there will be a modification. Therefore, the report will be called a modified audit report. Now remember, every time the auditor wants to give a qualified adverse or a disclaimer, the auditor will have to change words in the audit report. Therefore, the audit report will be called a modified audit report. Because not only would the auditor have to give this opinion in the opinion paragraph, the auditor would also have to give reasons for these opinions. So the auditor will have to discuss reasons why the opinion has been qualified or why an adverse opinion has been given or why a disclaimer is being given. Therefore, every time the opinion on financial statements is modified, the report will automatically be modified because the opinion words will be changed and reasons for a qualified opinion or an adverse opinion or a disclaimer will also have to be given. Now, these are the three additional paragraphs that may be added. Now, all three are not added at the same time. So all three of the paragraphs are not added at the same time. You are going to add an EONP or an OMP or a material uncertainty regarding going concern or MEGC. So when is a material uncertainty regarding going concern paragraph included? This is included when and listen to this carefully. There is an uncertainty and we've covered what material uncertainty regarding going concern is in the going concern session. If you have any confusions, you can now go back and go through the going concern session to brush up on your knowledge. When there is a material uncertainty regarding going concern and this is very important, it has been correctly disclosed in financial statements. This you have to remember. A material uncertainty regarding going concern paragraph is only used when there is a material uncertainty regarding going concern and it has been correctly disclosed in financial statements. Remember, this paragraph is not used to highlight any error at all. This paragraph is only used when there is a material uncertainty and the management has disclosed it correctly. So why does the auditor add this paragraph then? If it has been disclosed correctly, why should the auditor add it? Because remember, auditors have a duty of care, a duty of responsibility to shareholders. Not all shareholders understand financial statements. Not all shareholders are finance related people. So it is the auditor's job, it is the auditor's duty of care or responsibility to draw the shareholders attention to a specific disclosure given within financial statements so that they read it carefully and they know that there is an issue with this business's survival or this business may face an issue with regards to survival in the future. So it is the auditor's by discerning duty to draw the shareholders attention to words and issue within financial statements that has been correctly disclosed but the auditor wants to draw the attention of shareholders as well. And that's it. That's all you need to remember. So a material uncertainty regarding going concern paragraph is only added when there is a material uncertainty and it has been correctly disclosed. I want you guys to memorize this by heart. Why does the auditor add it? To enhance the shareholders understanding. To tell them, wait, there is an issue, why financial statements are free from misstatements. The going concern is uncertain. Please go on to page 116 or wherever it is and read up on that disclosure. And that's it. We are now going to look at when an EOMP is added or when an OMP is added. Let's first look at EOMP. EOMP stands for Emphasis of Matter Paragraph. So what are the circumstances where an EOMP may be used or may be added by the auditor? Remember, this is also never used to highlight an error in financial statements. It is only added to enhance shareholders understanding of financial statements. These are the two things that you have to remember. An EOMP, an Emphasis of Matter Paragraph is never ever used to highlight an error. It is always used to enhance the shareholders understanding of financial statements. Now when can it be used? It can be used to draw shareholders attention to a material pending loss. Let's suppose there is a material pending lawsuit at year end and the amount payable is going to be material if the lawsuit is lost or if the lawsuit is unsuccessful from the client's perspective. Now you know that there would be a disclosure in financial statements for this lawsuit in accordance with IAS 37. But you also know that shareholders are not finance people and they will not go on to the disclosures because they don't understand what they are. So what you do is you include a separate paragraph as an auditor in your report and tell shareholders please don't miss out on reading about this material pending lawsuit. So that they understand clearly this issue when they are reading financial statements and when they are taking important decisions with their money. Another circumstance where an EOMP may be used is to draw shareholders attention to another correctly given disclosure. So any disclosure that you deem is necessary, you know that disclosures or notes to the financial statements come right at the very end of financial statements. So you don't want shareholders to miss out on important information that is given in disclosure. So you could use as an auditor an EOMP to draw shareholders attention to any correctly given material disclosure that you think they should read. For example, if the business is not a going concern and alternative basis has been used, then there will be a disclosure given in financial statements. You could use the EOMP to draw shareholders attention to the disclosure that says hey this business is not a going concern and we prepared financial statements using alternative basis for accounting. So maybe that correctly given disclosure could be referred to. Remember EOMP is never used to highlight errors, it is only used to highlight shareholders' understanding of financial statements. So what does OMP stand for? OMP stands for Other Matters Paragraph. So when is this used? Again, this is never used to highlight errors. It is only used again to increase shareholders' understanding, so the same as EOMP, of financial statements. So both of these things are the same as EOMP. However, circumstances are different. This paragraph could be used to highlight that prior period or last year's financial statements were not audited. So remember prior period financial statements would be included in this year's annual report as comparative figures. If you want to tell the shareholders that hey use comparative figures very very carefully because they have not been audited, then you can use OMP in your report. Or you could say in the OMP, prior period financial statements were audited if they were by different auditors. So we weren't the auditors last year, we did not audit the comparative figures, somebody else did. You might want to look into that. So these are some of the circumstances that would warrant an OMP. Both of these circumstances for EOMP and OMP are given in your notes on page number 144 and 145. I would suggest that you go through them very very carefully and try and memorize them. So if you disregard the components written in red, this is the standard unmodified report format. Remember when I was talking about the fact that an unmodified report is unchanged from standard format? That is exactly what I am talking about over here. So what is an unmodified audit report? Unchanged from standard format. It will have a title where the auditor would say this is the statutory auditor's report for the year ended so and so. There will be addresses which are normally shareholders or in other cases shareholders and the board of directors. Then there will be an opinion paragraph. In an unmodified report, there will be clean opinion already mentioned in the opinion paragraph. However, when the auditor wants to modify the audit opinion then the wordings for this paragraph will be changed. Therefore, report will automatically be modified. The basis for opinion paragraph will specify reasons for opinion. So every single time the auditor wants to change the opinion, the basis for opinion paragraph will include reasons why opinion has been qualified or adverse or disclaimed. If there is a material uncertainty regarding the point concerned, it will be included immediately after the basis for opinion paragraph. Then there is a key audit matters paragraph. This is very very important because key audit matters paragraph is very important from exam perspective. Remember this is key audit matters so it is used to highlight any issues or circumstances that affected this year's audit. For example, key audit matters paragraph could include areas of significant risk and how the auditor dealt with those areas. It could include areas of judgment where significant judgment was used by the auditor or management and how did the auditor deal with that. It could have events or circumstances that are material to financial statements and how the auditor checked those or any other areas that the auditor think affected the year's audit and therefore should be communicated to the shareholders. So remember key audit matters paragraph could have any of these four. It could also be possible that for a year there could be no key audit matters that the auditor wanted to discuss. In that case, this paragraph cannot be deleted from the audit report. It would just simply say that there were no key audit matters during the year that the auditor wants to discuss. And that's about it. Remember key audit matters paragraph will be included and it could include any significant area of risk or judgment or significant events and circumstances and how the auditor dealt with these during the course of the audit. If there is an EOMP, it would be added after key audit matters paragraph and OMP after the key audit matters paragraph. So the position of material uncertainty regarding going concern paragraph and EOMP is important. Material uncertainty always features before CAM and EOMP always features after CAM. This is CAM, Key Audit Matters Paragraph. Then there is other information paragraph. Other information paragraph would include information other than financial statements. So if there is any other information that the auditor deems necessary to communicate to shareholders and which is outside of financial statements, then this is the paragraph that the auditor can use. Then the next paragraph would be responsibilities of management. Remember, we are going to reiterate the responsibilities of management here. For example, preparation of financial statements, prevention and detection of fraud and error and providing access to records, so on and so forth. Responsibilities of auditors, which include giving an opinion on financial statements or gathering evidence. Other regulatory requirements, if any. So if you're operating in a jurisdiction or a country where there are other regulatory matters that you need to follow, then this is the paragraph that you will use. And there is the engagement partner's signature, the name, address and date. Now, an important thing over here to remember is that you will not be asked to make an audit report in the exam. You won't be asked to do it. You will be asked to judge a scenario and tell how audit opinion or audit report will be changed. But you will not be asked to prepare a report in your exam at all. Just to reiterate, what do we write in CAM or Key Audit Matters Paragraph? Key Audit Matters Paragraph. Number one, significant areas of risk and how the auditor dealt with them. It could have significant areas of judgment and how the auditor dealt with these areas. It could have significant events or circumstances, transactions as well. And how the auditor dealt with them. So you can see that I'm repeating this again and again. How the auditor dealt with them. Because remember, this is Key Audit Matters Paragraph. And this is the auditor's chance to communicate with shareholders about any issues that they faced during the audit or any other areas that the auditor feels are necessary. Remember, if there are no Key Audit Matters to discuss, then the auditor cannot simply delete this paragraph from the report. What the auditor can do is write down that there were no Key Audit Matters to discuss during the exam. Let's now progress on to the exam technique. When you are given a scenario and when you have to judge the auditor's opinion and the impact on report of a particular scenario, this is the exam technique that you have to follow. You have to discuss the accounting issue and you have to mention how it affects financial statements. You have to calculate and comment on materiality. You have to mention the opinion and explain why you are giving a certain opinion. And then you have to mention the impact on report. So discuss the issue first, then comment on materiality, then mention opinion and finally report. In the next session, we are going to practice opinion and report both.
