 We're now going to cover computer assisted audit techniques and I want you guys to remember that these are small topics but can pack a powerful punch in your exam. That's because these small topics may form parts of bigger questions, bigger constructed response questions in your exam and they're always a confidence booster in the exam. If you remember these topics, these will give you easy marks and a confidence boost in the exam when you need it most. So computer assisted audit techniques are most commonly called CATS by students and teachers alike. Computer Assisted Audit Techniques. Let's look at what they are. So audit techniques or computer assisted audit techniques are used throughout the audit in two forms. Test data and audit software. Let's first look at test data. Test data is all of the fake data that is entered by the auditor particularly into the client's software in order to test it. You have to remember this. So in order to test it. So for example, if the client tells an auditor about computer controls then the only way to test those computer controls is through test data or through dummy transactions. Fake data is also called dummy transactions. That's one and the same thing. So for example, the client tells the auditor that access to non-current asset register is restricted. One way the auditor can check this is by entering a fake password into the non-current asset register to see if access is granted or not. Another example of test data or dummy transactions could be, let's suppose the client tells the auditor that customers whose credit limit has reached or has been exceeded their orders are refused by the system automatically. So the auditor could test this control by picking up a sample of customers that have already exceeded their credit limit and trying to enter an order into the system from that customer to see whether the order is accepted or rejected as claimed by the client. Another example of test data or dummy transactions could be, let's suppose that the client claims that attendance system is automatically transferred into the hours worked report. So when an employee marks their attendance, the hours worked report is automatically updated. One way to test it could be to enter a dummy attendance into the system to check whether the hours worked report is updated or not. So test data are essentially dummy transactions entered into the client's software by the auditor to test it.

Now there are three ways test data could be entered into the client's software. There could be live tests, dead tests or integrated testing facility. This is very easy and straightforward. I just want you guys to pay attention for a moment and this should be easy to grasp. Now live testing is when the auditor enters dummy transactions into the system during 9 to 5 working hours. We say this is live testing because at that point the system is live. So the client is processing their actual transactions and meanwhile the auditor enters dummy transactions into the system as well. The system is live because these are working hours and the client is processing normal transactions as well. One of the disadvantages of this is that there will be no way of knowing which transaction is a fake transaction if normal transactions and dummy transactions are being processed at the same time. So another example of test data is dead test. This is testing that is conducted after 5 pm. So after working hours. One of the advantages of a dead test would be that the client system is not live. The client is no longer processing normal transactions. Therefore whatever transaction that the auditor processes will be easily identifiable from the ledger because it will have a timestamp of after 5 pm. However a disadvantage is that you have no way of knowing that the controls that are applicable now on your dummy transactions were the same controls that are applicable during 9 to 5 as well. So in order to address both of these live tests and dead tests there is an integrated testing facility. Integrated testing facility is when the client software has an inquiry system put into it. So the client software can handle inquiries input into it by the auditor during working hours or after working hours. It wouldn't matter. The auditor would have their own login and password and whatever transactions are entered from that login and password would be processed through the system but would not end up in the ledger. So integrated testing facility is sort of the best of both worlds. It incorporates the advantages of live testing and it tries to avoid the disadvantages of a dead test. So that's one type of computer assisted audit technique. Test data.

Then there is audit software. Audit software is software developed for the auditors in order to facilitate their audit process. You have to remember this. So this is audit software developed for the auditors in order to facilitate their audit process. For example Ernst & Young uses GAMx or used GAMx back in my days. Caseware can also be used and audit software remember is for the auditor to facilitate the audit process. It can help in recalculations of figures. It can help in sampling specifically random sampling and monetary unit sampling which cannot be done without the help of a computer and a software. It can help in sorting and filtering information. So on and so forth. So it would help the audit process itself. Many firms can use audit software that is off the shelf. That is a normal general audit software that is made for all auditors or firms could have their own specific software developed specifically for their firm giving them exclusive rights over that software. So it is the firm's decision really.

One of the new additions to this topic is data analytics. Data analytics is a new entry into the ACCA syllabus. Therefore I would advise you guys to go through this topic in detail from your notes given on page number 168. So remember data analytics is the process of examining data to draw conclusions. Now you know that data analytics can now identify similarities or relationships within the data within seconds and help the auditor in reaching conclusions. Data analytics is used for big data where there is a lot of volume of data and a lot of forms of data that is accumulated and data analytics will help the auditor in identifying relationships and in identifying trends from that data. Data analytics can be used in the planning stage, tests of control stage, substantive procedures stage or evaluation of results. Let's first look at how it can be used in planning. In planning data analytics can be used to highlight unusual variances in a large amount of data to identify risk. So data analytics can be used to identify risky areas within financial statements specifically when the volume of transactions is very very high. It can be used in tests of controls to analyze credit limits allowed to customers during the year and whether any customers have exceeded their credit limits or not. So remember for one business there may be several customers during the year so the volume of transactions is going to be really high. If the auditor wants to identify which customer exceeded their credit limit during the year then one way to do it is to use data analytics is to use a computer software in order to mine the data and identify exceptions or errors from that data. It can be used in substantive procedures for analytical testing or it can be used for recalculations of depreciation charge during the year. It can be used to analyze at the substantive stage the capital expenditure versus revenue expenditure for a company and finally evaluation of results where data analytics would help the auditor achieve or reach results or evaluate results of any conclusions or any unusual variances that data analytics has identified. You will not be asked to use data analytics in your exam however you will be asked what it is and how it may help the auditor during the course of the audit like we just discussed. This could be a straightforward question carrying 5 to 6 marks. In the next session we cover fraud as a topic.
