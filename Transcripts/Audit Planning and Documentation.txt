 Another topic that we're going to cover in list of miscellaneous topics is documentation. Now bear in mind that all of these topics may be very very small, however they're very important from exam perspective. In the sense that there may be a small question in the exam that may ask you in a direct straightforward manner why documentation is important or the contents of a certain audit file. I would suggest that for these small topics that can score you easy marks you go through your notes and try and memorize certain areas in this topic. I'm going to suggest areas that you can try and memorize so that you can score well in the exam. Remember for the exam if you're wondering how important could one small topic be, the difference between a 49 and a 50 is always one mark. So this topic could carry that one essential mark that you need to make a successful attempt at the audit assurance exam. 

So why does an auditor document every single step during the audit or every procedure that the auditor applies during the course of the audit? So let's first look at the importance of documentation. Documentation provides evidence for the basis for auditor's conclusion and this is very very important. If in case the auditor's conclusion is contested, if in case somebody contests the auditor's conclusion and claims that the auditor's conclusion is wrong then the auditor should have sufficient documentation to form the basis for their conclusion and can prove through documentation that they did everything that was necessary to finish the audit with proper care. Documentation also provides evidence that the audit was planned and performed in accordance with ISAs. ISAs are international standards on assurance and remember ISAs are important because auditors have to comply with international standards when they're planning and performing the audit. Therefore documentation would give evidence that the audit was planned in accordance with the applicable standards. It will also assist the engagement team to plan and perform the audit. For example, if the system of sales or if the system of purchases is properly documented then it would be easier for the auditor to identify controls from that system and then test those controls in the future. It also assists supervision of the audit so if there are mistakes made by the auditors or if there are amendments that are needed to the audit procedure they would only be identified by reviewing documentation attached with the audit. It enables the team to be accountable for its work so supervisors and the audit managers and the audit partners would be able to hold the team members accountable for the tasks that they performed and if there are errors in their tasks then they know exactly who to ask. It also retains a record of matters of continuing significance to future audits. So future auditors or the next year auditors are going to use the prior year audit working papers in order to understand the audit methodology and in order to understand the issues that were identified and highlighted in the last year's audit. I would suggest that you learn these points from your notes. They're easy, they're straightforward and simple to remember.

There are two types of audit files that are going to be important from exam perspective. There's the current audit file and there's the permanent audit file. This is going to be one that is held or made for one client. Permanent audit file is one for one client. Current audit file is going to be different for every year. So current audit files will be different for 2019, different for 2020, different for 2018, so on and so forth. Permanent audit file contains those documents for a client that are not likely to change. For example, client's registration documents and copies. So registration documents, copies that highlight the client's legal status, the client's organizational structure that is not likely to change on a yearly basis, engagement letters, all of them. So if we have been auditing a client for five years then you would expect to find five engagement letters in the permanent audit file. Previous auditors reports, in essence, previous annual reports as well, important minutes of board meetings that contain significant decisions by the board. For example, acquisition of a subsidiary, so on and so forth. So if you look at all of these documents that are contained within the permanent audit file, these are documents that are not likely to change on a yearly basis. Registration documents or organizational structure or engagement letters which are made anew for every year, previous auditors reports, so on and so forth.

The current audit file is going to have documents or working papers that are attached or associated with this year's audit. So they would contain the current year's trial balance, the current year's risk assessment documentation, current year's ledgers and records, current year's sampling methods that are used, current year's list of misstatements and details about current year's substantive procedures. It could also have the letter of weaknesses for current year. And just to recap, letter of weaknesses is the letter the auditor makes for the management after tests of controls are finished so that management identifies or management knows the weaknesses or deficiencies that the auditor has identified from the client's transaction cycle and can look into the auditor's recommendations on how to remove those deficiencies from the system. If you don't remember what letter of weaknesses is, you can go back to internal control system's first session that is given to you in your course plan. So this was all about documentation. In the next session, we cover another miscellaneous topic, computer assisted audit techniques.
