 Internal audit is an integral part of corporate governance. Like I said before, corporate governance is basically an accumulation of guidelines on board structure, subcommittees of the board, as well as the internal audit function. We are now here. We covered the board structure and subcommittees of the board in the last two sessions. You must have gone through internal audit details in your FAB exam, accountant in business exam, and whatever details that you studied about internal audit there, you should be able to brush up on that knowledge in here. While you're not supposed to memorize all of the things that are associated with internal audit, some factors are important. Therefore, I've written them down in the slides for you guys to memorize. Now, internal audit is different from external audit and that's why I've taken care throughout the sessions to refer to us or myself as an external auditor. This is the first time that I'm going to talk about internal auditor. It is an independent appraisal activity established within an organization as a service to it. So it's just like any other department within an organization. It could be an in-house department or it could be outsourced to an audit firm. This decision to either keep it as an in-house department or outsource it to an audit firm would differ from business to business and both have their own advantages and disadvantages. The advantages and disadvantages of keeping an in-house department or outsourcing it are given in detail in your notes and I would suggest that you go through them once to familiarize yourself with them. This is a control in itself which functions by examining and evaluating the adequacy and effectiveness of other controls. So in order to make internal control systems or in order to make internal controls effective, an internal audit department is necessary because an internal audit department would keep examining and evaluating whether these internal controls within an organization are effective or not. Internal audit is not a regulatory requirement but external audit is for listed companies. That's why for listed companies external audit is also known as statutory audit because it's required by law but internal audit is not a regulatory requirement but it is a corporate governance best practice guideline. So it is required by corporate governance best practices.

How are internal auditors kept independent if they are employed by the business? Remember external auditors are kept independent because they are independent third parties that are employed by the shareholders. Internal auditors are employed by the business just like any other employee is recruited. So how are they independent? They do not design and implement controls. You have to remember them. While they're responsible for monitoring and reviewing controls, they do not make controls and they do not implement controls. That is the management's job. They report to the audit committee and that is effective for their independence because audit committee also only has independent non-executive directors. They are free to decide on the nature and scope of their work. So what they're going to check and in how much detail they're going to check it is decided by the internal auditors themselves or in some cases given as an assignment by the audit committee but not by the management. So given by the audit committee. They are free to communicate fully with the external auditors as well. So they can communicate with the external auditors if they have found issues with the company's operations.

So do all businesses need an internal audit department? The answer is no. All businesses do not need an internal audit department. Only those businesses that find it cost beneficial will have an internal audit department. These are bigger businesses by the way students because bigger businesses have lots of controls that they need another department to monitor. So only those businesses will have an internal audit department where the cost of that department will be less than the benefits that they will reap from internal audit. The size and complexity of operations is also a factor. Big businesses and complex businesses will need an internal audit department. Why? Because their managers will be tasked with running their operations. They cannot check controls therefore there will be a separate dedicated department a dedicated resource that is only tasked with checking controls at all times. Internal auditors can help in risk assessment and reviewing controls. So only those businesses will have internal audit department whose risks evolve regularly. For example businesses in dynamic environments, businesses with fast-paced technology where risks change therefore controls need to change too. Businesses with problems in existing controls will need an internal audit department. So if businesses had fraud in the past that indicates that their controls are ineffective therefore they may need an internal audit department to tell them where these inefficiencies are so that they can remove them. And the need of special assignments that normally internal auditor carries out for example investigation into fraud or investigation into a whistle-blowing tip into fraud. So if audit committee needs some transactions checked because they fear they may be fraudulent then internal auditor can check those as part of special assignments. So not all organizations would have internal audit department only those organizations would have them that fulfill these criteria.

So how are internal auditors different from external auditors? Because really right now the difference is only these words internal and external. This table is very important from exam perspective and I would suggest that you learn it by heart. The first difference between internal auditors and external auditors is how they're appointed. Internal auditors are appointed by management or in most cases the audit committee while external auditors are hired by shareholders in an annual general meeting through an ordinary resolution or a simple majority. The second difference is between objective: while internal auditors are tasked with checking effectiveness of internal controls, the external auditors need to express an opinion on the truth and fairness of financial statements. Internal auditors reports are addressed to the board or in most cases the audit committee while external auditors report is addressed to the shareholders. We have done this in the report section of this syllabus and you can go back to that session and revise it if you're unsure. The scope of internal auditors work includes operations of a company while external auditors are focused on financial statements only. Their relationship with the organization is also different. Internal auditors might be employees if it's an in-house department or it may be outsourced to a firm while external auditors are completely independent third parties. There is no familiarity, there is no advocacy, there is no self-interest or self-review and if you don't know what I'm talking about go through the ethics session of your syllabus. Finally, the differences between planning and evidence collection. There is no materiality based testing in internal audit and it is primarily based on internal evidence that is generated by management. However, an external auditors work is based on materiality on risk and they gather both evidence from internal sources and external sources like lawyers or banks or valuers so on and so forth. This is what an internal audit department is and this is how it is different from an external audit function. This marks the end of corporate governance and internal audit as a topic. We're now going to practice it.
