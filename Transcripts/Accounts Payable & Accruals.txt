In the last sessions, we covered substantive procedures that are linked with assets. Now we are going to begin the audit of liability side. While it is pretty similar to the audit of asset side, the liability side audit sort of focuses on completeness as an assertion. That's because management is more likely to omit liability related transactions than assets. Therefore, you will see that most of the audit of liabilities will focus on completeness assertion. We are going to keep revising our assertions so that you know exactly what we are talking about when we talk about the audit of assertions. Now we are going to be covering substantive procedures related to accounts payables and accruals. Like always, I have mentioned on your slides that you have to learn the procedures from your notes. On your notes, they are given on page number 112 of your student notes. Make sure that you are going through these procedures and you are learning them as many as possible from the notes. So what we are going to do is we are going to follow an example. Like always, within this example, we are going to take the example of XYZ Company, which is a client. And the year end of XYZ Company is 31st December 2019. Let's suppose that the total accounts payable reported by XYZ Company at year end was $50,000. Now we know that this $50,000 is absolutely not owed to one supplier. These are probably multiple suppliers at year end with amounts outstanding and the total of those amounts is $50,000. The first step that the auditor would take would be obtaining a break-up schedule. Like always, and you should remember this procedure by now, let's suppose the break-up schedule is such that there are three suppliers with outstanding amounts at year end A, B and C. The amounts owed were $15,000 for A, $15,000 for B and $20,000 for C, bringing the total to $50,000. The second step that the auditor is going to take is cast the break-up schedule, check the addition, so that we can ensure that our starting point of audit is correct and therefore the rest of the audit is also more likely to be correct. Now, the third procedure is a tricky one. Confirmation letters or supplier circularization can be done. Confirmation letters can be sent or it is also called circularization. Can be performed. However, now I want you to listen to this very, very carefully. Confirmation letters or supplier circularization is rare in practice. It is hardly ever done. Why is that so? So, if the question in your exam says, is our confirmation letter sent to suppliers? The answer is yes, they can be sent to suppliers. But if the question asks, is that normal practice by the auditor? The answer is no, it is not normal practice. Why? Because the auditors already have sufficient third-party audit evidence available in case of suppliers to not want a confirmation letter. For example, we have purchase invoices that are prepared by suppliers. We also have supplier statements. Just like banks send bank statements, suppliers also send monthly supplier statements. Within these supplier statements, the suppliers will have summarized all transactions that occurred with a particular supplier during the month. So, the supplier statement is prepared by the supplier and sent by the supplier, which forms a third-party audit evidence. Now, in presence of purchase invoices and supplier statements, it is highly unlikely that the auditor is going to need another confirmation letter when they already have supplier statements for the month of December. So, while confirmation letters can be sent to suppliers, it is not normal practice because the auditor would then be duplicating efforts by asking for a confirmation letter when a supplier statement already exists. Having said that, let's begin the Assertion Vise audit. The first assertion that we are going to talk about is existence. The second is completeness. The third is accuracy, valuation and allocation. We are going to be talking about rights and obligations. And we are going to talk about cut-off as well. I am going to tell you why. So, let's first talk about existence for a moment. Remember what existence is. Existence means there is no falsification. The chances of falsification of payables are very very rare or very very low. Why? Because management will not want to falsify liabilities. Therefore, for existence, a couple of procedures that can be used are 1. Purchase invoices. Because if purchase invoices for a particular supplier exist, then the supplier also existed. And the second is supplier statements. If a supplier has sent a statement at month end, then that means that the supplier existed at year end and that it has not been falsified. Completeness however is another story altogether. Completeness means no omission. Now this is going to be important because we are talking about reliability and management may feel the pressure to understate liabilities by omitting transactions. So, for completeness, what can we do? The first procedure that we can apply is a substantive analytical procedure. We can compare current payable balance with last year. Now, all of this is good, but the last part of the sentence will be the same. So listen to this carefully. Compare current payable balance with last year to identify and investigate unusual differences. I want you to learn this last part of the sentence. To identify and investigate unusual differences. Now see how I am going to use this last part of the sentence for almost all substantive analytical procedures that I am going to write. I could also compare individual supplier balances with last year to identify and investigate unusual differences. You could also reconcile general ledger with payable ledger, which is also called control account reconciliation. To identify and investigate unusual differences, you could reconcile supplier statements with payable ledger to identify and investigate unusual differences. For completeness, select a sample of post-year-end payments and check if the invoice was dated before your end that a liability was created. Now what does that mean? Listen to this carefully. Let's suppose I pick up a post-year-end payment that is dated 5th January 2020. I pick this payment up from the post-year-end bank statement. I ask the management to give me the invoice for this particular payment. The management gives me the invoice and the invoice relates to a purchase made on 28th December 2019. Since the invoice is dated 28th December 2019, I want to see whether a liability was created at 31st December. Because a purchase was made on 28th December and no payment was made at year-end. Therefore, it fulfills the criteria of a liability. So, I select a sample of post-year-end payments, I obtain their respective invoices and I check and the auditor would check whether these invoices date to before year-end and that a liability was recorded. For accuracy evaluation and allocation of the year-end balance, supplier statements should be sufficient. So, this entire procedure would read out as Verify the outstanding balance of suppliers adherent from the supplier statements. You could also verify the outstanding balance from unpaid purchase invoices. Or a confirmation letter if that's been sent. If it is sent, remember confirmation letters are rare in practice for suppliers. For rights and obligations, it is easy. Since a purchase was made, remember the definition of a liability. It is a present obligation due to a past event. As an auditor, you would have to check whether the obligating event has occurred. In case of a purchase or in case of a supplier balance or a payable balance, the purchase is the obligating event. If the business has purchased something and not paid for it, then that's the obligating event. Therefore, a liability exists. So, we're going to check supplier statements, which are going to specify whether purchases were made and not paid for or purchase invoices. And that's about it. Now, remember what cut-off was. Cut-off was checking the matching principle, ensuring that purchases have been recorded in the correct accounting period. Now, remember, for cut-off, we're going to check when risks and rewards were transferred, because a purchase should be recorded when risks or performance obligation is met and risks and rewards are transferred. Therefore, cut-off is going to be checked using goods receipt notes. Now, what is the auditor going to do? Listen to this carefully. The auditor is going to obtain a sample of goods receipt notes before year end and some goods receipt notes after year end. And the auditor is going to follow through the goods receipt notes to their respective ledgers to see whether goods receipts have been recorded in the correct accounting period. If you notice, I've written payables and accruals side by side. That's because the audit of accruals and the audit of payables match together. Why? Because payables are amounts outstanding against purchases, while accruals are amounts outstanding against expenses. There's no real difference in the audit of the two. In the next session, we are going to be covering a practice question of payables.
