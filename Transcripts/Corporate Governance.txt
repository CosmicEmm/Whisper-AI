 We are towards the end of our session. However, we are going to do one of the most important topics within your syllabus, corporate governance. For most of you, you must have noticed that while this topic feature is pretty early on in your syllabus guide, I am doing it towards the end. That's because in order to understand corporate governance as a topic, you need to have an overall understanding of how an audit works and how a business works as well. Therefore, when students have gone through the entire syllabus and have a good idea of what the organization is and how the audit is supposed to work, we then start corporate governance. You've already done a part of this corporate governance in your FAB exam, accountant in business exam and would see that as we progress along the session, that the details associated with this particular topic in AA exams are almost similar. So corporate governance will be very easy for you guys to comprehend. This has very recently been tested in the audit assurance past exam papers and may feature again in a constructed response question. One objective test question is normal for the examiner to give against corporate governance and a constructed response question may also be tested in the exam. So prepare this well. This is not a lot of material to learn and details on this particular topic are given in your notes as well. So we are going to go through this topic and let's begin. Corporate governance, basically what it is.

Corporate governance is a set of guidelines for directors on how to run a company. So this is basically a set of guidelines for directors on how best to run or govern a company. Why are we studying it in audit and assurance? Because sometimes the external auditor or us, as I have referred to throughout these sessions that sometimes the auditors have to check compliance with corporate governance for a company. How do we check compliance with corporate governance if we don't know what it is? So we are going to study the details of corporate governance particularly because we need to know what it is if we are to check compliance with corporate governance.

Before we look at what corporate governance ensues, let's look at how corporate governance may be applied by companies. It can be a principle based approach or a rule based approach depending on the type of country that we are talking about. With principle based approach, companies have flexibility. So they can seek listing on stock exchange without having to comply with corporate governance and the companies have flexibility. They only have to explain why they are non-compliant plus when they will be fully compliant with corporate governance principles. However, in countries that apply corporate governance as a rule, their companies cannot get a listed status until they comply with corporate governance. So this is basically the basic difference between a principle based approach and a rule based approach. In a principle based country, companies that seek listing will have flexibility. So they can either comply with corporate governance or explain why they are not compliant and when they can be compliant. In a rule based country, companies cannot get the listed status if they are non-compliant with corporate governance. So rule based countries do not give flexibility to listed companies at all. Right now, at the moment, United States is the only country in the world that has rule based approach and over there, corporate governance has been legalized in the form of the Sabines-Oxley Act. Principle based approach is followed by UK, subcontinent, most of Europe, so on and so forth. Best practice has to be applied. So basically, corporate governance ensures that best practices are related to the board structure, subcommittees of the board and internal audit have been applied. So basically, corporate governance is the accumulation of three things. It gives companies guidance on the board structure. It gives companies guidance on subcommittees of the board. And it gives companies guidance over internal audit. Now what you need to remember is that we are going to talk about board structure in this session. In the next session, we are going to talk about subcommittees of the board and in the third session, we are going to talk about the internal audit. This session particularly will just focus on the board structure.

Now what does corporate governance say about structure of the board? Corporate governance says that there should be two types of directors on the board. Executive directors that run the company and earn a remuneration and non-executive directors that protect shareholder interest on the board. They do not earn a remuneration. They earn a fixed fee based on number of meetings attended. So I want you guys to remember this. There are two types of directors on the board. Both types of directors will have equal legal status and there will be one vote per director available. Executive directors run major operations of a company. So for example, chief executive officer will be an executive director, chief operations officer will be an executive director, chief finance officer will be an executive director, so on and so forth. And they earn a remuneration for their services. Non-executive directors do not run the company. They just sit on the board to protect shareholder interest and they are paid a fixed fee based on the number of meetings attended. Normally students ask how is this fixed fee decided upon? This fixed fee is decided upon the market rates, how similar companies in the industry are paying the non-executive directors. The second thing that corporate governance requires in the board structure is segregation in the CEO and chairman roles. According to corporate governance, the chairman of the board should be a non-executive and should be responsible for running the board. Chairman of the board will run the board and the chief executive officer will be an executive director and will run the company. If one person is the CEO of a company and the chairman as well, then remember this person will have unaccountable power. So this person will not be accountable to anybody for the power. They will run the board because they will have the casting vote. Casting vote means the veto power. Therefore they can veto any decision that they want and they will run the company as well. Therefore making the entire board ineffective. If one person is running the company and the board, then I don't need the rest of the board to tell me what to do. I can take the decision in isolation. I don't want any suggestion from anybody at all. Therefore corporate governance says the CEO of a company and chairman of the board should be two different people. These roles should be segregated. Now a lot of you also ask but this is the case in a lot of companies. I know that is true. I know this is the case in a lot of companies but that is not the best practice. The third provision or the third requirement of corporate governance is that there should be balance in the board. Balance in the board in numbers and balance in the board in skills. Now remember balance in the board as far as executive directors and non-executive directors are concerned. So there should be equal number of executive directors and non-executive directors. If the board has 11 members and now listen to this carefully, one will be the non-executive chairman of the board while five will be executive directors and the rest of the five will be non-executive directors. This is called a balanced board. The non-executive chairman of the board is not included in that balance because this person has casting vote or the veto power. So five executive directors with five votes and five non-executive directors with five votes as well. If the board is not balanced then one party will be able to dominate the other party. So if executive directors are more than non-executive directors then the executive directors will all vote on one decision and pass it without the non-executive directors vote. If the numbers are balanced then executive directors will need at least one non-executive director to vote on their decision in order to pass it in the board. So remember the corporate governance principles suggest that a board should be balanced in numbers of executive directors and non-executive directors. Non-executive directors should not be able to dominate decision making and executive directors should not be able to dominate decision making either. The other thing that there should be a balance in is skills. So there should be a balance in skills to improve quality of decision making. This is very very important because if the board only has finance related people then a decision may be very viable from finance perspective but might not be as viable from marketing perspective or from administration perspective. Therefore all skills should be represented on the board in order to improve the quality of decision making. There should be diversity on the board. Diversity means ethnic, cultural, gender diversity on the board in order to ensure that there are representatives of different ethnicities, cultures and genders on the board in order to improve the quality of decision making. Now diversity is important for global companies that have global operations in all over the world. If global companies do not have representation on the board for genders, cultures and ethnicities then it is very unlikely that this company will understand what consumers want. For a company like Honda or Toyota that operates all over the world they need to have a diverse board in order to understand what consumers want from their product in different parts of the world. When it comes to corporate governance there should be different subcommittees of the board and we are going to talk about these subcommittees in the next session. So just hold off on that. Corporate governance requires that directors be formally inducted into the organization, into the board. That means induction training. Induction training means that the directors should be made aware of what their job description is, what their responsibilities are and who they are working with. So induction training means the initial training that is conducted for directors when they are hired on the board of directors. So they will be given their responsibilities, they will be introduced to other directors on the board who they are working with, they are going to be introduced to some of the previous minutes of meetings so that they are brought up to speed on what the company is deciding right now. They could be given previous financial statements so that they are familiarized with various accounting policies and procedures that are applicable within the company. Corporate governance requires that there is continuous professional development of directors. Continuous professional development means keeping skills up to date. So remember that these directors will have joined the company 15 to 20 years back and these directors will have done their academic qualifications then. It is important that these directors keep their skills up to date through continuous professional development training so that their skills are up to date and the benefit of this CPD training can be reaped by the company. There will be annual performance appraisal in order to ensure that director performance is up to the mark. Directors should be, according to corporate governance, re-elected every 3 years so that they do not become complacent and the company has the chance to get rid of a director that is underperforming. But 3 years as a benchmark is important. You don't want to re-elect directors every single year because you need directors to be familiar with how the company is run. If a company changes directors every year, they will end up having directors that do not understand the business at all. Therefore, directors are re-elected after 3 years in order to ensure that the impact of their decisions is weighed when they are re-elected and that they understand the business. There should be regular board meetings in order to deliberate on important decisions. The company should have a sound system of internal controls as well as an internal audit department. We will talk about this in the next session. There should be risk management. We are talking about business risk here, not audit risk. So we are talking about risks that can affect the organization, which are the management's responsibility. There should be adequate risk management or frequent business risk management so that organization is not affected by adverse circumstances. There should be an internal audit department. Again, we are going to cover this in session after the next one. There should be transparency in reporting. Transparency means annual reports that are handed over to shareholders are free from manipulation and do report on facts and figures truthfully. And institutional shareholders should intervene in the company when needed. So institutional shareholders are normally majority shareholders of a company. Therefore since they are majority shareholders, they have high voting rights too. According to corporate governance, institutional shareholders should be given the chance to intervene or interfere in the company's affairs when it is needed. For example, when the company is underperforming consistently, so consistent underperformance. When the company is taking too many risks. When the company is making unethical decisions, they can intervene in the company. They can ask the chairman of the board to hold an emergency meeting and give explanations. Or when the company is disregarding non-executive directors. Or when the non-executive directors are ineffective. So there are a lot of reasons why institutional shareholders may want to interfere in the company's affairs. And they can interfere because they have high voting rights. And they may interfere when the company is consistently underperforming, taking too many risks, making unethical decisions or disregarding the non-executive directors. In the next session, we cover an important area of corporate governance which is the subcommittees of the board.
