 In this session, we are going to be covering substantive procedures related to directors' remuneration. Directors' remuneration is very important from audit perspective since this is an area that is going to be inherently risky. Why is it inherently risky? Because it involves related party transactions. Directors are considered related parties of a company and any remuneration or salary that they earn from the business is considered a related party transaction, therefore inherently risky. We are going to take the same example that we do always. We are auditing XYZ company. The year end is 31st December 2019 and the directors' remuneration expense is roundsabouts of $100,000. The first step to the audit of directors' remuneration is the same that we have covered before. So what we are going to do is, number one, obtaining a break-up schedule and cast it for accuracy. These are procedures that you need to memorize as they are. The second thing, now let's talk about the components of a director's remuneration package. There will be basic salary. There will be bonuses. There will be perks or benefits in kind. So I'm just going to write. So benefits in kind would be medical insurance or fuel reimbursement or mobile phone reimbursement so on and so forth. There may be share options or there may be pension benefits. We are primarily going to be focusing on basic salary and bonuses. The first thing is looking at the approval of basic salary. This can be or this approval can be verified by reviewing minutes of remuneration committee meetings. Now remember, a director's remuneration is set by a remuneration committee. We are going to look at what remuneration committee is in detail when we cover corporate governance portion of our syllabus. Now this is a portion that we are going to cover after review and opinion so gear up for that as well. But remember, the approval for basic salary of directors can be verified by reviewing minutes of remuneration committee meeting. Second, the amount of basic salary can be verified from personal records. Remember, every director will have an appointment letter and within that appointment letter their basic salary will be mentioned. The amount can also be confirmed by reviewing bank statements because remember basic salary is something that will be paid on a monthly basis. By reviewing monthly bank statements, the amount of basic salary can be confirmed from a third party document which will form a reliable form of audit evidence. Next, bonuses approval will also be checked by reviewing remuneration committee meetings. The payment of bonus can be checked by reviewing bank statements. If the bonus is paid during the year, then yearly bank statements can be checked. If it is paid after the year end, then post-year-end bank statements can be checked. The eligibility of bonus will also be checked. So you have to check whether the director is eligible for receiving the bonus or not. We will have to recalculate the achievement of performance targets. Now I am going to give an example. Let's suppose the company has promised a director that the director will get a bonus once sales volume has increased by 10%. So the auditor will try to calculate the growth in sales volume and will ensure whether that growth is 10% and whether the director was eligible to receive the bonus or not. So eligibility will be checked by recalculating the achievement of performance targets to ensure that the director was eligible to receive the bonus. The payment itself can be checked from bank statement and the approval can be checked from minutes of board meetings. For benefits in kind, the approval will be checked in the exact same manner. However, the disclosures will be checked because benefits in kind have to be disclosed by reviewing notes to the financial statements. So notes to financial statements will be reviewed to ensure that adequate disclosures have been given for remuneration components of directors. Similarly, if there is any insurance policy that the company has taken out for a director, then the insurance documents will be reviewed. So on and so forth. For share options and pension contributions, personal records can be checked and approval can be checked from reviewing minutes of board meetings. This was the audit of directors remuneration. Not only was it small, it is actually very, very straightforward as well. However, from exam perspective, it is very important. Try and go through the procedures that are given in your study notes. Visit page 117 and try and memorize as many procedures as possible.
