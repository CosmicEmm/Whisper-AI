In the last session, we covered an unqualified audit opinion. Before I delve into this session, I want to recap what we did in the last session. So in the last session, we covered that there will be a list of misstatements that the auditors would take to the management or directors to discuss with them. Out of these misstatements, certain will be material while others will be immaterial. Some will be adjusted by the management upon recommendation of the auditor while others may not be adjusted by management upon recommendation of the auditor. At this point, the auditor needs to check whether these misstatements that are left unadjusted are material to financial statements or not. Because if these misstatements that are unadjusted are immaterial, then the auditor would have to aggregate them first and check whether the aggregate of these misstatements is material or not. So at this point, we are going to cover modified audit opinion. In the last session, we covered unmodified, clear or unqualified audit opinion. Now, unmodified audit opinion is also called unchanged, clean, unqualified audit opinion. This opinion will be given when there are no material misstatements that are left unadjusted. So no material misstatements that are left unadjusted in financial statements. This also means that there may be immaterial misstatements in financial statements that do not require the auditor to change or modify their audit opinion.

Now, there are three kinds of modifications. If the auditor wants to change the audit opinion, then there are three types of changes that the auditor can incorporate. The first is qualified opinion, the second is adverse opinion, and the third is a disclaimer. We are going to begin with the first one. But remember, in the exam, you can expect a question where you will be given a scenario or a set of circumstances and you will be asked to judge what audit opinion will be provided by the auditor in different scenarios. You should be able to read a scenario and judge for yourself what kind of audit opinion will be given by the auditor.

Let's first look at qualified opinion and under what circumstances is this given. A qualified opinion is given when there is a material misstatement in an area of financial statements or the auditor is unable to gather sufficient, appropriate audit evidence in a material area. Over here, there are two words important, in "an" area or in "a" material area, indicating one. This is one. Let me give you an example. Let's suppose the auditor is auditing company XYZ for the year ended 31st December 2019. Planning materiality in this example is going to be $5,000. Now, depreciation charge in financial statements was $50,000. However, depreciation calculated by the auditor was $60,000. This error suggests that depreciation by management has been understated by $10,000. So $10,000 worth understatement in depreciation. This also means that assets have been overstated by the same amount. So if depreciation has been understated, then assets have been overstated. Now this is material because it exceeds the materiality level. And let's suppose management refuses to make the correction in their financial statements. What is the opinion that the auditor would give? In this case, there is a material misstatement, but in only an area and that is depreciation. Therefore, the auditor can give a qualified opinion. In this case, a qualified opinion would suggest that except for this matter, everything else in financial statements presents a true and fair view of the business. So the wordings that we use for qualified opinion in an auditor code are "Except for this matter, everything else in financial statements presents a true and fair view of the business." Let's take another example. This time I'm going to give an example of inability to gather sufficient appropriate audit evidence in a material area. So we're auditing company XYZ on 31st December 2019. Total value of inventory was $100,000. Materiality is the same. These are two different examples. So materiality is the same, $5,000. Let's suppose there was inventory at a third party warehouse where the inventory held was roundabouts of $8,000 worth of inventory. Now this inventory was not counted by the auditor and neither has the auditor received any confirmation letter from management of the third party warehouse. Therefore, the auditor was unable to gather sufficient appropriate audit evidence in a material area. So the auditor was unable to confirm the existence and completeness of this particular inventory that was held at a third party warehouse. Let's suppose all other inventory was verified by the auditor. So what is the opinion that the auditor may give? The auditor would give an opinion that except for this matter that I have highlighted, everything else in financial statements presents a true and fair view of the business. So qualified opinion is when the auditor wants to change the opinion but only in one area of financial statements. As you can see, while these two are material, they do not affect other areas in financial statements. Remember, you are talking about double entry system. So profit will be affected in all cases, whatever error you are talking about. So anything that affects profit is not affecting multiple areas because remember we are talking about double entry system. So there will be certain errors that will have an impact on profit as well. However, in both these examples, you can clearly see that the issue or the error was affecting one particular area of financial statements. Therefore, we say except for these matters, everything else in financial statements is fine. Let's take one more example before we move on to the next type of modified opinion. Let's suppose the auditors are auditing company ABC. The year end was 30th June 2019. Now within this, the total receivable balance was $60,000 and materiality was $3,000. So I'm just changing the figures a little bit. Let's suppose there was a receivable that was outstanding at year end worth $4,500. And the auditors think that it should be written off because it has been outstanding for a very long period of time. Management disagrees and thinks that this amount will be recoverable. However, auditor has applied all other procedures and are of the opinion that $4,500 should be written off. The management disagrees. So $4,500 is material because it exceeds $3,000 materiality. But this is an area that affects receivables only. Therefore, it is a material misstatement, but only restricted to one area. Therefore, a qualified opinion will be given. So qualified opinion is given under two circumstances. One, when there is a material misstatement, but is limited to one area within financial statements. Or two, when the auditor is unable to gather sufficient appropriate audit evidence in a material area or a single area.

Let's now move on to the second kind of modified opinion, adverse opinion. So there is only one circumstance where adverse opinion is given. This opinion is given when there is a material and pervasive misstatement in financial statements. So what does the word pervasive mean? We know that material is anything that exceeds materiality benchmark. But what exactly is pervasive? Remember, I want you guys to remember. Pervasive is anything that affects multiple items in financial statements. So multiple account balances and classes of transactions within financial statements. Or anything that has the ability to turn profit into losses. I want you guys to remember this. So materiality is anything that exceeds the benchmark. And pervasive is anything that affects multiple items in financial statements or has the ability to turn profit into losses. So how is adverse opinion different from qualified opinion? In qualified opinion, we were just talking about material misstatements or inability to gather sufficient appropriate audit evidence in a material area. While in adverse opinion, we are talking about not just material errors, we are talking about pervasive errors that affect the entire set of financial statements. An example is, now listen to this carefully. Let's suppose we are auditing company ABC for the year ended 30th June 2019. Now, on this date, management has decided that financial statements will be prepared on going concern basis. Because they think the business will be able to continue for the foreseeable future. However, auditors confirm that going concern of the business is very unlikely and are exactly sure that the business will not be able to continue for the foreseeable future. Therefore, the auditors think that financial statements should be prepared on a breakup basis or alternative basis. Now remember what breakup basis is. Breakup basis is preparing financial statements on an alternative basis. By this I mean that the auditor has found indicators as well as confirmed those indicators through procedures and has reached the conclusion that financial statements should be prepared on a breakup basis. Now breakup basis or alternative basis of accounting is such that it affects multiple areas. How does it affect multiple areas? Because all assets, tangible non-current or intangible non-current, will be reclassified as current. All liabilities would be reclassified as current. And all assets would be written down to their realizable values. So we are talking about substantial changes in a lot of account balances and in classes of transactions. And that's how breakup basis affects multiple areas. Now let's suppose the auditor takes this conclusion and discusses it with management. And management disagrees and holds on to their opinion that financial statements should be prepared on normal basis. And in this circumstance, the auditor cannot say except for this matter, everything else is fine. Because there is nothing else left. So the auditor gives an adverse opinion. An adverse opinion would apply on the entire set of financial statements. It would be a blanket opinion saying, in our opinion, financial statements do not present a true and fair view of the business. So adverse opinion does not leave anything else to chance. Remember, adverse opinion would be saying, in our opinion, financial statements do not present a true and fair view of the business. Let's take one more example of adverse opinion. Let's suppose the auditor is auditing company XYZ for the year ending 31st December 2019. XYZ has a subsidiary that XYZ controls. However, management does not consolidate the subsidiary's financial statements. Now this is very very important. Since the subsidiary is controlled entirely by XYZ, it should be consolidated. So the auditors take this opinion and discuss it with management and advise the management that subsidiary's financial statements should be fully consolidated. And management disagrees. Now under these circumstances, again, if you remember consolidation from FFA, you will know that consolidation affects all account balances and all classes of transactions as well other than equity. Therefore, this is something that is not only material, it is also pervasive. Why is it pervasive? Because it affects multiple items in financial statements. Therefore, an adverse opinion will be given, where the auditor will say, in our opinion, financial statements do not present a true and fair view of the business. So we are down two types of modified opinion, qualified and adverse.

Let's go to the third, which is disclaimer. So a disclaimer is an opinion which is given when the auditor is unable to gather sufficient appropriate audit evidence in a material and pervasive area. Now this is very very important because to give a disclaimer, pervasive area would be important. Pervasive definition remains the same. Pervasive is anything that affects multiple account balances and classes of transactions or has the ability to turn profit into losses. Now, when would a disclaimer be given? Remember, a disclaimer is given when an auditor is unable to gather evidence in a material and pervasive area. Now let's take an example. Let's suppose we are auditing company XYZ for the year ended 30th June 2019. Within this, they had total revenue of $1 million and the ledger was corrupted during the year when it was being transferred from the old system to the new system. Now since the ledger was corrupted, there can be no tracing or vouching. Everything else in financial statements is fine, but revenue for the year cannot be verified through tracing or vouching because the ledger is not present. It was corrupted while it was being transferred from the old system to the new system. Now, revenue is not only material, it is also pervasive. How is it pervasive? Because it has the ability to turn profit into losses. If the entire revenue was subtracted from profit, the profit would turn into loss. Therefore, revenue is not only material, it is also pervasive. Under these circumstances, the auditor would give a disclaimer and would say that the auditor would be unable to give an opinion on the entire set of financial statements. Remember, the auditor would give reason too. So the auditor would give a reason in their report saying that we are not giving an opinion on financial statements because we were unable to gather sufficient appropriate audit evidence on revenue which is not just material, it is pervasive. So, a disclaimer is given because of an inability to gather sufficient appropriate audit evidence in a material and pervasive area.

Now, just to recap all of the modified opinions and just to tell you how to summarize this topic, there are three kinds of modified opinions. There is qualified opinion, there is adverse opinion and there is a disclaimer. Qualified opinion is given when there is a material misstatement or when the auditor is unable to gather sufficient appropriate audit evidence. But in both these cases, there is one commonality. The auditor is unable to gather sufficient appropriate audit evidence or there is a material misstatement in one area. Adverse opinion is given when there is a material and pervasive misstatement. Remember, pervasive is anything that has the ability to affect multiple accounts at the same time or has the ability to turn profit into losses. And disclaimer is given when the auditor is unable to gather sufficient appropriate audit evidence in a material and pervasive area. Now, an easy way to remember this is that anything that is not pervasive cannot be included in an adverse or a disclaimer. So, it has to be qualified. 

So, I want you guys to remember this tree, this one that I've just made, as it is. If you can memorize this tree and if you can reproduce it in the exam, so every time a question comes based on opinion, what you can do is you can make this in your scratch pad. I can assure you that if you've learned this tree and if you can make it correctly in your exam, you will be able to get every question right on opinion. But if you have not learned this or if you cannot reproduce it, then you will not be able to get questions right with regards to opinion in your exam. In the next session, we cover a practice question.
