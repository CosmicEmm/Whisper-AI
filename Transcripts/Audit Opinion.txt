 We are now going to progress on to audit opinion. This is a session that is to come immediately after review. An audit opinion is very important from exam perspective and may feature in section A or section B of your exam. Now since it may feature in section A, you have to remember that your concepts should be crystal clear for you to be able to do well in section A. Section A is only attempted well by those students who are very very good as far as concepts are concerned. Now audit opinion is a huge topic so I have broken it down into sub-sessions.

Before audit opinion is formed, there is a list of misstatements that the auditor would prepare. Now listen to this carefully. During the course of our audit, during the course of control testing or during the course of substantive procedures, there will be several misstatements that the auditors will find. Now remember auditors cannot remove these misstatements themselves. These misstatements have to be removed by the management and they have to be proposed by the auditor. Therefore remember that while auditors can detect misstatements, they cannot remove them from financial statements themselves. Their removal has to come from management who is responsible for preparing financial statements. So let's suppose hypothetically that the audit for the year ended 31st December 2019 has stopped. So the substantive procedures are over and review is over and during the course of this audit there were some misstatements that the auditor found. Out of these misstatements, A is a material misstatement, B is also material, C is immaterial, D is also immaterial, and E is material. So these are all of the misstatements that the auditors found. Let's suppose this list of misstatements is taken to the management. It will be discussed with the management and the auditors will discuss how they think these are misstatements as well as how they can be removed from financial statements. Let's suppose after discussion with management, management agrees to adjust A in financial statements according to the auditor's suggestion, B is also adjusted and let's suppose E is also adjusted. However, management refuses to adjust C and D. What should the auditor do then? The first step is since they are both immaterial, the auditor would add them both or take out an aggregate. Aggregate is also adding them both and check whether the aggregate of both these errors is material or not. If the aggregate is material, then the auditor will go back to the management and tell them that since the aggregate is material, it will have an impact on their opinion. But if the aggregate is immaterial, then the auditor may proceed to form an opinion. So remember, before opinion is formed, a list of misstatements is made by the auditor. Out of these misstatements, certain will be material while others may be immaterial. These misstatements and their impact on financial statements will be discussed with the management. The management may agree to adjust some of them while others may be left. If the misstatements that are left are immaterial, then the auditor would first add them up, take an aggregate and check whether the aggregate is material or not. If the aggregate is immaterial, then the auditor has the chance to form an opinion. But if the aggregate is material, then the auditor has to go back and discuss it with the management.

Now, once an audit opinion is starting, you need to know that there are two types of audit opinion. There is unmodified audit opinion or modified audit opinion. This session is going to be based on unmodified audit opinion. We are going to look at modification in the next session. So taking the example further, remember what in the previous example we decided. We decided that there were two immaterial misstatements and their aggregate was also immaterial. Therefore, they were left unadjusted by the management and the auditor wanted to form an opinion. This opinion will be unmodified. Unmodified opinion means unchanged from standard format. It is also called unqualified opinion or clean opinion. So all are synonymous. A clean audit opinion, unmodified audit opinion or an unqualified audit opinion is the auditor's opinion that financial statements present a true and fair view of the business. Now remember, while we are saying that in our opinion, financial statements present a true and fair view of the business, we are not saying that there are no errors in financial statements because like we discussed before, there are errors in financial statements, but they are immaterial in individually and in aggregate. Therefore, they have no impact on the auditor's opinion. Having said that, now you should be able to reconcile with the earlier sessions as well, where we decided that absolute assurance or guarantees on financial statements cannot be given by the auditor. That's because even when the auditor says that in our opinion, financial statements present a true and fair view of the business, that does not mean that financial statements are 100% free from errors. That simply means that there are errors, but they are immaterial. Therefore, they do not impact the auditor's opinion. You have to remember that and this is one of the reasons why we do not give absolute assurance on financial statements. An unmodified opinion is also called a clean opinion. We've just covered that. It can also be called an unqualified opinion. This means that material misstatements have been adjusted by management and errors that are left unadjusted are immaterial individually and in aggregate. This means that auditor's evidence suggests that financial statements do truly reflect the condition of the business. In the next session, we are going to see how the auditor's opinion may be modified or changed.
