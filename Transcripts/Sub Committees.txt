 In the last session we talked about the board structure as far as corporate governance was concerned. In this section or this session we are going to be talking about subcommittees of the board. Now remember corporate governance is an accumulation of guidelines on board structure that we did in the previous session, guidelines on subcommittees of the board that I discussed in the last session that we are going to be doing in this session and then internal audit or internal controls that we are going to be doing in the next session. So this is done, we are here, this is what's to come next.

So there are four subcommittees of the board that are required by corporate governance principles. This first one being nominations committee, second is remuneration committee, the third is risk management committee and the fourth is audit committee. Very often students ask but all companies don't have these subcommittees of the board. That's because these subcommittees of the board are just a guideline, are just a principle. Companies do not have to have them for listing on the stock exchange but they should have them as far as best practices are concerned for corporate governance.

Let's first look at nominations committee. Now nominations committee should be comprised of, so comprised of both executive directors and non-executive directors. So there will be executive directors as well as non-executive directors on the nomination committee. So what is the nomination committee responsible for? Nomination committee is responsible for ensuring diversity on the board. So we talked about diversity and why it is beneficial for a company in the last session. If you want to brush up on that knowledge you can go to the last session and revise why diversity is important. So who ensures that the board is culturally or ethnically or gender-wise diverse? The nominations committee. They're responsible for nominating executive directors and non-executive directors on the board. Remember the word is nominating not appointing because executive directors and non-executive directors are appointed by shareholders of a company. They are responsible for identifying gaps so if the board is not balanced in numbers then the nomination committee is responsible for identifying gaps in the board and they are responsible for ensuring balance in skills as well. So we talked about balancing skills and we talked about the fact that there should be a representation of all skills required in an organization on the board. That means a representation of marketing, administration, finance, operations, procurement so on and so forth. Why is a balance in skills necessary in order to ensure good quality decision-making? So a nominations committee just to summarize is responsible for nominating executive directors and non-executive directors on the board of directors. It is comprised of both executive directors and non-executive directors. It will ensure diversity. It will ensure balance in numbers and skills on the board.

The second subcommittee of the board is the remuneration committee. This should have only non-executive directors. So remember a remuneration committee should only have non-executive directors. There should be no executive director on the remuneration committee. Why? Because this committee is responsible for deciding remuneration package of executive directors. So each executive directors remuneration package will be designed by the remuneration committee and that's why executive directors cannot be in this committee because they cannot end up deciding their own remuneration themselves. Right. So the remuneration committee ensures that executive remuneration is enough to attract, retain and motivate directors. So it is the remuneration committee's responsibility to ensure that executive directors remuneration is enough to attract new directors, retain old directors and motivate them to perform better in their own interest and the company's interest. Remuneration committee is responsible for ensuring that there is an equal split between basic salary and performance related bonuses in executive directors remuneration. Why? If basic salary proportion is too high, if the remuneration package is split as such 75% basic salary and 25% performance related element then the director will simply not be motivated enough to improve company's performance because the director knows that he or she is only going to get 25% of their entire remuneration package based on that performance. If performance related element is too high, if it is the opposite, if 75% of remuneration package is based on performance related element then that would motivate the director to manipulate accounts in order to earn a higher bonus. That's why the remuneration committee ensures that there is an equal split a 50-50 split between basic salary and performance related bonus so that the director does have security as far as finances are concerned and the director also has the motivation to improve company performance. Remuneration committee should also ensure that directors are not overpaid. So they will ensure that the basic salary of directors matches the market rates. By market rates I mean how much are other directors earning with similar skills within the industry. So that's the remuneration committee roles.

Then there is the risk management committee. Risk management committee has both executive directors and non-executive directors. They are responsible for identifying, assessing and managing business risks and that's why executive directors are important in this committee. Why? Because they have knowledge of the business, because they run the business so they are in a better position to identify which risks can affect the business, how important are those risks for the business and how should they be managed. Non-executive directors will bring independent scrutiny while executive directors will help in identifying and assessing business risks. Remember business risks are all risks that may affect the performance of a company or an organization.

The last is audit committee and this is by far the most important from your syllabus perspective. Audit committee has only non-executive directors. There should be no executive director in an audit committee. An audit committee is responsible for ensuring financial statements are prepared with honesty and integrity. They will ensure that financial statements are complete and clear and that's why not only should the audit committee have only non-executive directors there should be at least one finance professional in the audit committee. This is important. So there should be at least one finance professional within the audit committee. Why? Because their primary role is to ensure the clarity and completeness of financial statements. They will ensure that all disclosures are complete within financial statements and that financial statements are straightforward and honest. Their second role is with regards to internal control systems. With regards to internal control systems the audit committee is responsible for monitoring internal control systems and ensuring that they are updated regularly. Now remember internal control systems and monitoring of internal control systems has already been discussed in a previous session based on internal control systems. If you have any confusion on why they should be regularly monitored you should go back to internal control system session and brush up on that knowledge. The audit committee's third responsibility is with regards to external auditors. They're responsible for nominating external auditors. Only nominating it is important because external auditors are appointed by shareholders. They're responsible for supervising the external audit process. They are responsible for ensuring that external auditors are independent and this is important because external auditors independence can only be monitored by the audit committee since it is comprised of only independent non-executive directors. So remember only independent non-executive directors can supervise the independence of external auditors as well. Their fourth responsibility is with regards to internal auditors. They hire the chief internal auditor or the head of that department. So they will hire chief internal auditor. They will set the scope of internal audit assignments. Internal auditors will report to the audit committee. So the internal auditors report to the audit committee so on and so forth. The audit committee members are also responsible for ensuring compliance with laws and regulations. And finally audit committee is responsible for ensuring whistleblowing procedures are maintained. Now if you know what whistleblowing procedures are you should be fine. However for those of you who don't know what whistleblowing procedures are I'm just going to revise it for a bit. Whistleblowing is when an employee from within an organization wants to highlight fraud that is suspected within that organization. Now remember when employees want to highlight fraud what they want to ensure is that their name is kept anonymous and their job is secure. Now employees will only be encouraged and motivated to highlight fraud or to blow the whistle on fraud if they are sure that not only will their jobs be secure and their names are kept anonymous but also that there will be some follow-up procedure on the fraud too. Now this assurance can only be provided by the audit committee because it is only comprised of non-executive directors. Therefore whistleblowing procedures are designed by the audit committee and any whistleblowers tip is given to the audit committee so that they can get it investigated.

In all of the four subcommittees of the board there is one commonality. That commonality is the chairman of the board cannot be a part of any subcommittee of the board. Why? Because the chairman of the board has more of a supervisory role. The chairman of the board is responsible for supervising all subcommittees of the board and if the chairman of the board was a part of one of the subcommittees then there would be self-review. If the chairman would have to review his or her own work as a part of the subcommittee then they will not be objective. That's why it is best practice that chairman of the board maintains a supervisory role and does not form a part of any subcommittee of the board. In the next session we are going to cover internal audit.
