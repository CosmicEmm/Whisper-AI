In this session, we are going to be covering sampling. So you've heard about sampling a lot. We've talked about sampling extensively when we talk about substantive procedures. But how is a sample selected? And how does sampling affect an auditor's conclusions?

Let's first look at what sampling is. Audit sampling is the application of audit procedures to less than 100% of items within a population of audit relevance. What exactly does that mean? That if receivable ledger has a total of 1000 transactions, then the entire 1000 transactions will be called population. And if the auditor chose 200 transactions to test, then these 200 would be the sample. That's what it means. We covered sampling in reasons why absolute assurance cannot be given or why guarantees cannot be given on financial statements. That's because if one receivable ledger has a total of 1000 transactions, the auditor is not going to check them all. The auditor is going to be applying procedures on 200, 300 or maximum 500 transactions and is going to be giving an opinion on the entire population, which means all 1000 transactions. Therefore, having checked only 50% of the transactions, the auditor can be reasonably sure but cannot be absolutely sure. Now there is something called a sampling risk too. This is the risk that the auditor's conclusions based on a sample may be different from conclusions if the entire population were subject of the same audit procedure. In simpler words, this is the risk that sample may not represent the entire population. So this means choosing the wrong transactions in your sample. If you have chosen wrong transactions on your sample, then no matter what procedures you're going to apply, the conclusions that you're going to arrive at are going to be incorrect. That's because your procedures could be exemplary, your procedures could be absolutely perfect. But if you're applying them on wrong transactions, then the conclusions based on those transactions are also going to be incorrect. Therefore, in order to reduce sampling risk, it is very important for the auditor to ensure that they're choosing correct transactions in their sample and that there is no sample bias. So there is not a single kind of transaction in the entire sample. There are two basic methods to select a sample. The first method is statistical sampling and the second is non-statistical sampling. Statistical sampling is any method that is based on probability and mathematics. So these are the methods that are based on probability and maths. So algorithms are used. The first example of statistical sampling is random sampling. Random sampling is where a computer software is used. So random sampling cannot be done without a computer software. Where a computer software is used and every transaction within the population has an equal chance of being selected. Now, this is very important. For samples that are chosen randomly, there will be all kinds of transactions in the sample. There will be small transactions, bigger value transactions, one-off transactions, transactions conducted with related parties. So all kinds of transactions will be chosen in a random sample simply because it is chosen with the help of a computer software and every transaction within the ledger is given an equal opportunity to be selected. Remember, you will not have to perform random sampling in the exam. You may be asked its definition, therefore you have to learn it. Then there is monetary unit sampling. Monetary unit sampling is also done with the help of a computer software. So it can't be done manually. This is where every $1 within ledger has an equal chance of being selected. Now, this is different from random sampling in the sense that random sampling ensued or included every transaction had an equal chance of being selected. While monetary unit sampling is every $1 within the ledger has an equal chance of being selected. There is a slight variation between the two but both are done with the help of a computer software. In both of these cases, the chances of a biased sample are lower. Why? Because every transaction or every $1 is given an equal chance of being selected. Therefore it is very unlikely that your sample will have a single type of transactions in it. Your sample will have a multitude of transactions and different types of transactions. Therefore, whatever procedures you apply on these transactions, the chances are that the conclusions reached will be correct. Systematic sampling can be done manually. And this is where transactions are chosen after a regular interval. So, what does that mean? How do you calculate that interval? So, for systematic sampling, the interval is chosen or interval is calculated as total population divided by sample size. So, this means that for example, if the total population has 1000 transactions and the auditor wants to check 200 transactions, then the interval would be 5. That means every 5th transaction from the ledger will be selected. You begin with the 5th transaction, you then select the 10th, then the 15th, 20th, 25th, so on and so forth. That means whatever 10th transaction or 5th transaction there may be, it will be selected in the sample. The chances of bias in this sample will also be very very low because we are going to choose the 5th transaction regardless of what value it carries. Whether it is high value or low value is beside the point. Then there are non-statistical methods of sampling and remember the risk of bias in non-statistical samples because it is very likely that in these types of sampling methods, the sample will have a bias in one or more form. The sample may have similar kinds of transactions. Where sample bias is higher, then there are higher chances that the auditor may give wrong opinion on financial statements. The first is haphazard sampling where there is no real method and the auditor sort of just selects invoices based on no particular pattern. And then there is block selection. This is where, let's suppose I am going to divide, so I am just going to give an example of block selection. This is where I am going to divide the entire population based on high value transactions, medium value transactions and low value transactions. This is based on my judgment. This is why this is non-statistical. High value transactions will be all those transactions that are above $5000. Medium value are from 1000 to 4999 while low value are below 1000. So all of this bifurcation in population is based on my own judgment. That's why this is non-statistical sampling. So I would decide to test 25% of all high value items, 20% of all medium value items and only 5% of low value transactions. In this kind of sample, there will be a sample bias. The sample will be biased towards transactions above $5000 because I am choosing them more than the others. So therefore there will be a higher risk of bias in this sample. This is also called non-statistical because it is based on my judgment as an auditor more than maths or a probability algorithm. So remember, while you may not be asked to identify or while you may not be asked to select samples in your exam, you will be asked to define certain sampling methods. So you are supposed to remember the definitions of these sampling methods.

The last concept that we are going to do in this session is the concept of extrapolation. Extrapolation takes the result of a sample and projects that result over the whole population. This means, let's suppose total receivables as at year end, whatever that year end may be, were $1000. The sample of receivables was for $500. That means 50% sample was selected. From this sample, errors worth $60 were identified. So I checked 50% of receivables and I found that from 50% $60 worth of errors were identified. Can I now say that if the sample has $60 worth of errors, the total population may be susceptible to errors worth $120. I've doubled this. So $120 which is double that of 60. Since if I checked 50% and found $60 worth of errors, I could double that and say the entire population may be susceptible and listen to this carefully, I'm saying may be susceptible to $120 worth of errors.

I can only project the errors of a sample onto the entire population if I have chosen my sample based on statistical sampling methods. Why? Because statistical sampling methods are not biased. They have all kinds of transactions. Therefore, I can project the errors of a sample onto the entire population without any reservation. But if I chose the sample based on non-statistical methods of sampling, then I cannot extrapolate. Then I cannot project errors from a sample onto the entire population. So remember, extrapolation is projecting errors from a sample onto the population. But extrapolation only works when the sample is used or chosen using statistical methods of sampling. In the next session, we cover another topic.
