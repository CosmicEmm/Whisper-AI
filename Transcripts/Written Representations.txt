 We are now going to talk about the third component of review. The first one was subsequent events. The second one was going concern. The third one is written representations. And then we are going to do overall review of financial statements. So what do we know about written representations so far? These are written statements by the management to the auditor. So let's just look at a little bit of detail regarding written representations. In the exam you may get a question that is direct straightforward. So you have to learn some concepts related to written representations. Remember for direct straightforward questions you have to prepare them by learning concepts. So the first one is what is the purpose of written representations? The first purpose of written representation is acknowledgement of responsibility by management. Remember several times during the audit there are several misunderstandings about what the management is responsible for and what the auditor is responsible for. Every single time the auditor is going to ask for an acknowledgement by management to ensure that management completely understands what they are responsible for, the auditor may ask for a written representation. For example, acknowledgement of responsibility for preparation of financial statements. Acknowledgement of responsibility for prevention and detection of fraud and error. Or providing access to records. So providing access to records. Written representations may also be used to confirm any verbal commitments made by management. So for example management says that there were no subsequent events after year end, the auditor may ask the management to write it down and sign and stamp the statement. Remember it is always best to take written representations where verbal comments have been made by management because remember verbal comments cannot be used in the court of law to defend an auditor against a negligence lawsuit. However written statements may form a basis for defense. We can use written representations as audit evidence in cases where no other audit evidence exists. Where no other form of audit evidence exists. Or you may use written representations to confirm existing evidence. So where you have existing evidence and you want to seek further clarification, you may still obtain a written representation. So these are some of the purposes of a written representation. Again details of these purposes are given in your study text and I would suggest that you go through them once. However are written representations reliable? The answer is not as reliable as other forms of audit evidence. You have to remember this now. If the question asks you are written representations a form of audit evidence? The answer is yes, they are a form of audit evidence. But if the question is are they reliable forms of audit evidence? The answer is no, they are not reliable forms of audit evidence. Why? Because remember written representations are made by people whose work you are checking. So there may be misrepresentations in them. There may be fraudulent statements in them. So where are written representations used? Where no other evidence exists. Right? So it may be used where no other audit evidence exists. However, even then written representations are not reliable as audit evidence. So how does the auditor use them? The auditor uses them to confirm or to corroborate. So these are two synonymous words, confirm or corroborate existing audit evidence. I'll explain this. Now the depreciation policy may be told to the auditor by the management. The auditor may obtain a written representation to confirm the depreciation policy as well. But the auditor can't stop there and say that's it. I've checked depreciation policy because I've taken a written representation on it. The auditor needs other form of audit evidence as well. For example, comparing depreciation policy with last year to check whether it is consistently applied and comparing it with industry average to check whether it is reasonable or not. The auditor may compare the depreciation policy with the standards too. And then the auditor may take a written representation to confirm the evidence that the auditor already has. But written representation in isolation in the absence of all other audit evidence cannot be reliable form of audit evidence. It may be used to confirm existing audit evidence, but it cannot be used in isolation as a reliable form of audit evidence. I'll give you another example. As an auditor, let's suppose I have taken whatever steps are necessary to identify subsequent events. I've read minutes of post-year-end board meetings. I've read interim financial statements. I've obtained confirmation from lawyers and I found no subsequent event. To confirm this, I obtained a written representation from management as well, saying that they have no knowledge of any subsequent event that occurred after year end. They will sign this written representation and stamp it. But what I cannot do is do nothing to identify subsequent events and ask the management to just give me a written representation. That is not appropriate. I need to do whatever is in my power to collect all forms of audit evidence and then I can obtain a written representation on top of it to confirm the audit evidence that I have. So this is something that you need to remember. What if management refuses to sign a written representation? So let me form a scenario for you. So the scenario is that the management has verbally confirmed the depreciation policy to the auditor. The auditor then asks management to write the depreciation policy down in written representation and sign it and stamp it. The management refuses and says, while we can tell you verbally what our policy is, we will not write it down and we will not sign or stamp it. This indicates that there might be a problem in the policy that they are telling us. So what does the auditor do? The first is the auditor discusses the issue with the board of directors. Board of directors or also called those charged with governance. We will discuss the issue with the board of directors or those charged with governance and try to explain to them why signing the written representation is important. The second step, if the board is not convinced, is to write the letter. So the auditor would write the letter themselves and ask the directors to sign it. So if management still refuses to sign written representation, we can write the representation ourselves and ask the directors to sign it. If directors refuse to sign the written representation as well, we will then change our opinion. How we will change our opinion? We are going to talk about this in the upcoming sessions and mention in our report. And we are going to mention the fact in the audit report. We are going to essentially tell shareholders that there was a written representation that needed to be signed and it has not been signed by the management or directors either. This would indicate that this area is prone to fraud because there is something that the management is refusing to confirm with the written representation. This was all about written representations. In the next session, we are going to go on and read the overall review of financial statements. You are not going to see a practice session for this particular area. That's because this area is normally tested in a direct straightforward manner. Therefore, you have to learn the concepts themselves. There is no scenario based question on written representations. So we are going to progress on to the next session. That is going to be the overall review of financial statements.
